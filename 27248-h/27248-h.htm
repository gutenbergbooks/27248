<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<i>The Challenge of the Mound</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was a curious, somehow
weird-looking thing, that
mound. About a yard in height
and three and a half in diameter,
it squatted in the grassy grove
next the clump of trees like an
enormous, inverted soup plate. Here
and there tufts of grass waved on
it, of a richer, deeper color, testifying
to the unwholesome fertility
of the crumbling outer stuff that
had flaked from the solid mound
walls.</p>

<p>Like an excrescence on the flank
of Mother Earth herself, the mound
loomed; like an unhealthy, cancerous
growth. And inside the enigmatic
thing was another world. A
dark world, mysterious, horrible,
peopled by blind and terrible demons&mdash;a
world like a Dante's dream
of a second Inferno.</p>

<p>Such, at least, were the thoughts
of Dennis Braymer as he worked
with delicate care at the task of
sawing into the
hard cement of a
portion of the
wall near the
rounded top.</p>

<p>His eyes, dark brown and rimmed
with thick black lashes, flashed
earnestly behind his glasses as they
concentrated on his difficult job.
His face, lean and tanned, was a
mask of seriousness. To him, obviously,
this was a task of vital
importance; a task worthy of all
a man's ability of brain and logic.</p>

<p>Obviously also, his companion
thought of the work as just something
with which to fill an idle
afternoon. He
puffed at a pipe,
and regarded the
entomologist
with a smile.</p>

<p>To Jim Holden, Denny was
simply fussing fruitlessly and
absurdly with an ordinary "ant-hill,"
as he persisted in miscalling
a termitary. Playing with bugs, that
was all. Wasting his time poking
into the affairs of termites&mdash;and
acting, by George, as though those
affairs were of supreme significance!</p>

<p>He grinned, and tamped and relighted
the tobacco in his pipe. He
refrained from putting his thoughts
into words, however. He knew, of
old, that Denny was apt to explode
if his beloved work were interrupted
by a careless layman. Besides,
Dennis had brought him here
rather under protest, simply feeling
that it was up to a host to do
a little something or other by way
of trying to amuse an old college
mate who had come for a week's
visit. Since he was there on sufferance,
so to speak, it was up to
him to keep still and not interrupt
Denny's play.</p>

<p>The saw rasped softly another
time or two, then moved, handled
with surgeon's care, more gently&mdash;till
at last a section about as big as
the palm of a man's hand was loose
on the mound-top.</p>

<p>Denny's eyes snapped. His whole
wiry, tough body quivered. He visibly
held his breath as he prepared
to flip back that sawed section of
curious, strong mound wall.</p>

<p>He snatched up his glass, overturned
the section.</p>

<p>Jim drew near to watch, too,
seized in spite of himself by some
of the scientist's almost uncontrollable
excitement.</p>

<p>Under the raised section turmoil
reigned for a moment. Jim saw a
horde of brownish-white insects,
looking something like ants, dashing
frenziedly this way and that as
the unaccustomed light of sun and
exposure of outer air impinged
upon them. But the turmoil lasted
only a little while.</p>

<p>Quickly, in perfect order, the termites
retreated. The exposed honeycomb
of cells and runways was deserted.
A slight heaving of earth
told how the insects were blocking
off the entrances to the exposed
floor, and making that floor their
new roof to replace the roof this
invading giant had stripped from
over them.</p>

<p>In three minutes there wasn't a
sign of life in the hole. The observation&mdash;if
one could call so short
a glimpse at so abnormally acting
a colony an observation&mdash;was over.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Denny</span> rose to his feet, and
dashed his glass to the
ground. His face was twisted in
lines of utter despair, and through
his clenched teeth the breath whistled
in uneven gasps.</p>

<p>"My God!" he groaned. "My God&mdash;if
only I could see them! If only
I could get in there, and watch
them at their normal living. But it's
always like this. The only glance
we're permitted is at a stampede
following the wrecking of a termitary.
And that tells us no more
about the real natures of the things
than you could tell about the nature
of normal men by watching their
behavior after an earthquake!"</p>

<p>Jim Holden tapped out his pipe.
On his face the impatiently humorous
look gave place to a measure of
sympathy. Good old Denny. How
he took these trivial disappointments
to heart. But, how odd that
any man could get so worked up
over such small affairs! These bugologists
were queer people.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, half really
to soothe Denny, half deliberately
to draw him out, "why get all
boiled up about the contrariness of
ordinary little bugs?"</p>

<p>Denny rose to the bait at once.
"Ordinary little bugs? If you
knew what you were talking about,
you wouldn't dismiss the termite
so casually! These 'ordinary little
bugs' are the most intelligent, the
most significant and highly organized
of all the insect world.</p>

<p>"Highly organized?" he repeated
himself, his voice deepening.
"They're like a race of intelligent
beings from another planet&mdash;superior
even to Man, in some ways.
They have a king and queen. They
have 'soldiers,' developed from
helpless, squashy things into nightmare
creations with lobster-claw
mandibles longer than the rest of
their bodies put together. They
have workers, who bore the tunnels
and build the mounds. And
they have winged ones from among
which are picked new kings and
queens to replace the original when
they get old and useless. And all
these varied forms, Jim, they hatch
at will, through some marvelous
power of selection, from the same,
identical kind of eggs. Now, I ask
you, could you take the unborn
child and make it into a man with
four arms or a woman with six legs
and wings, at will, as these insects,
in effect, do with theirs?"</p>

<p>"I never tried," said Jim.</p>

<p>"Just a soft, helpless, squashy
little bug, to begin with," Denny
went on, ignoring his friend's levity.
"Able to live only in warm
countries&mdash;yet dying when exposed
directly to the sun. Requiring
a very moist atmosphere, yet exiled
to places where it doesn't rain for
months at a time. And still, under
circumstances harsher even than
those Man has had to struggle
against, they have survived and
multiplied."</p>

<p>"Bah, bugs," murmured Jim
maddeningly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> again Denny ignored him,
and went on with speculations
concerning the subject that was
his life passion. He was really
thinking aloud, now; the irreverent
Holden was for the moment nonexistent.</p>

<p>"And the something, the unknown
intelligence, that seems to
rule each termitary! The something
that seems able to combine
oxygen from the air with hydrogen
from the wood they eat and
make necessary moisture; the something
that directs all the blind subjects
in their marvelous underground
architecture; the something
that, at will, hatches a dozen different
kinds of beings from the
common stock of eggs&mdash;what can it
be? A sort of super-termite? A
super-intellect set in the minute
head of an insect, yet equal to the
best brains of mankind? We'll
probably never know, for, whatever
the unknown intelligence is, it
lurks in the foundations of the
termitaries, yards beneath the surface,
where we cannot penetrate
without blowing up the whole
mound&mdash;and at the same time destroying
all the inhabitants."</p>

<p>Jim helped Denny gather up his
scientific apparatus. They started
across the fields toward Denny's
roadster, several hundred yards
away&mdash;Jim, blond and bulking, a
hundred and ninety pounds of
hardy muscle and bone; Denny wiry
and slender, dark-eyed and dark-haired.
The sledge-hammer and the
rapier; the human bull, and the
human panther; the one a student
kept fit by outdoor studies, and the
other a careless, rich young time-killer
groomed to the pink by the
big-game hunting and South Sea
sailing and other adventurous ways
of living he preferred.</p>

<p>"This stuff is all very interesting,"
he said perfunctorily, "but
what has it to do with practical
living? How will the study of bugs,
no matter how remarkable the bug,
be of benefit to the average man?
What I mean is, your burning zeal&mdash;your
really bitter disappointment
a minute ago&mdash;seem a bit out of
place. A bit&mdash;well, exaggerated
don't you know."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Denny</span> halted; and Jim, perforce,
stopped, too. Denny's
dark eyes burned into Jim's blue
ones.</p>

<p>"How does it affect practical living?
You, who have been in the
tropics many times on your lion-spearing
and snake-hunting jaunts,
ask such a thing? Haven't you ever
seen the damage these infernal
things can do?"</p>

<p>Jim shook his head. "I've never
happened to be in termite country,
though I've heard tales about
them."</p>

<p>"If you've heard stories, you have
at least in idea of their deadliness
when they're allowed to multiply.
You must have heard how they
literally eat up houses and the
furnishings within, how they consume
telegraph poles, railroad ties,
anything wooden within reach. The
termite is a ghastly menace. When
they move in&mdash;men eventually move
out! And their appearance here in
California has got many a nationally
famous man half crazy. That's
what they mean to the average person!"</p>

<p>Jim, scratched his head. "I didn't
think of that angle of it," he
admitted.</p>

<p>"Well, it's time you thought of
something besides fantastic ways
of risking your life. The termite
has been kept in place, till now, by
only two things: ants, which are its
bitterest enemies, and constantly attack
and hamper its development;
and climatic conditions, which bar
it from the temperate zones. Now
suppose, with all their intelligence
and force of organization&mdash;not to
mention that mysterious and terrible
unknown intelligence that
leads them&mdash;they find a way to
whip the ants once for all, and to
immunize themselves to climatic
changes? Mankind will probably be
doomed."</p>

<p>"Gosh," said Jim, with exaggerated
terror.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Laugh</span> if you want to," said
Dennis, "but I tell you the
termite is a very real menace. Even
in its present stage of development.
And the maddening thing is that we
can't observe them and so discover
how best to fight them.</p>

<p>"To get away from the light that
is fatal to them, they build mounds
like that behind us, of silicated,
half-digested wood, which hardens
into a sort of cement that will
turn the cutting edge of steel. If
you pry away some of the wall to
spy on them, you get the fiasco I
was just rewarded with. If you try
to penetrate to the depths of the
mystery, yards underground, by
blowing up the termitary with gun
powder, the only way of getting
to the heart of things&mdash;you destroy
the termites. Strays are seldom
seen; in order, again, to avoid light
and air-exposure, they tunnel
underground or build tubes above
ground to every destination. Always
they keep hidden and secret.
Always they work from within,
which is why walls and boards they
have devoured look whole: the
outer shell has been left untouched
and all the core consumed."</p>

<p>"Can't you get at the beasts in
the laboratory?" asked Jim.</p>

<p>"No. If you put them into glass
boxes to watch them, they manage
to corrode the glass so it ceases to
be transparent. And they can bore
their way out of any wood, or even
metal, containers you try to keep
them in. The termite seems
destined to remain a gruesome, marvelous,
possibly deadly mystery."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> laughed abruptly, shrugged
his shoulders, and started toward
the car again.</p>

<p>"When I get off on my subject,
there's no telling when I'll stop.
But, Jim, I tell you, I'd give years
of my life to be able to do what all
entomologists are wild to do&mdash;study
the depths of a termite mound.
God! What wouldn't I give for the
privilege of shrinking to ant-size,
and roaming loose in that secretive-looking
mound behind us!"</p>

<p>He laughed again, and slapped
Holden's broad back.</p>

<p>"<i>There</i> would be a thrill for you,
you bored adventurer! There would
be exploration work! A trip to
Mars wouldn't be in it. The nightmare
monsters you would see, the
hideous creations, the cannibalism,
the horrible but efficient slave system
carried on by these blind, intelligent
things in the dark depths
of the subterranean cells! Lions?
Suppose you were suddenly confronted
by a thing as big as a
horse, with fifteen-foot jaws of
steely horn that could slice you in
two and hardly know it! How
would you like that?"</p>

<p>And now in the other man's eyes
there was a glint, while his face
expressed aroused interest.</p>

<p>Every man to his own game,
thought Denny curiously, watching
the transformation. He lived for
scientific experiments and observations
having to do with termites.
Holden existed, apparently, only
for the thrill of pitting his brain
and brawn against dangerous beasts,
wild surroundings, or tempestuous
elements. If only their two supreme
interests in life could be combined....</p>

<p>"How would I like it?" said Jim.
"Denny, old boy, when you can
introduce me to an adventure like
that ..." He waved his arm
violently to complete the sentence.
"What a book of travel it would
make! 'The Raid on the Termites.
Exploring an Insect Hell. Death in
an Ant-hill....'"</p>

<p>"Termitary! Termitary!" corrected
Denny irritably.</p>

<p>"Whatever you want to call it,"
Jim conceded airily. He dumped the
apparatus he was carrying into the
rear compartment of the roadster.
"But why speak of miracles? Even
if we were sent to a modern hand
laundry, we could hardly be shrunk
to ant-size. Shall we ramble along
home?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<i>The Pact</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"What</span> are we going to do
to-night?" asked Jim.</p>

<p>Dennis looked quizzically at his
big friend. Jim was pacing restlessly
up and down the living room
of the bachelor apartment, puffing
jerkily at his eternal pipe. Dennis
knew the symptoms. Though he
hadn't seen Jim for over a year,
he remembered his characteristics
well enough.</p>

<p>Some men seem designed only
for action. They are out of step
with the modern era. They should
have lived centuries ago when the
world was more a place of physical,
and less of purely mental, rivalry.</p>

<p>Jim was of this sort. Each time
he returned from some trip&mdash;to Siberia,
the Congo, the mountainous
wilderness of the Caucasus&mdash;he was
going to settle down and stop
hopping about the globe from one
little-known and dangerous spot to
another. Each time, in a matter of
weeks, he grew restless again, spoiling
for action. Then came another
impulsive journey.</p>

<p>He was spoiling for action now.
He didn't really care what happened
that evening, what was
planned. His question was simply
a bored protest at a too tame existence&mdash;a
wistful hope that Denny
might lighten his boredom, somehow.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do to-night?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Denny solemnly,
"Mrs. Van Raggan is giving a reception
this evening. We might go
there and meet all the Best People.
There is a lecture on the esthetics
of modern art at Philamo Hall. Or
we can see a talkie&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Lord!" fumed Jim. Then:
"Kidding aside, can't you dig up
something interesting?"</p>

<p>"Kidding aside," said Dennis, in
a different tone, "I have dug up
something interesting. We're going
to visit a friend of mine, Matthew
Breen. A young man, still unknown,
who, in my opinion, is one of our
greatest physicists. Matt is a kind
of savage, so he may take to you.
If he does&mdash;and if he's feeling in a
good humor&mdash;he may show you
some laboratory stunts that will afford
you plenty of distraction.
Come along&mdash;you're wearing out
my rugs with your infernal pacing
up and down!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Matt Breen's</span> place was in
a ratty part of the poorer
outskirts of town; and his laboratory
was housed by what had once
been a barn. But place and surroundings
were forgotten at sight
of the owner's face.</p>

<p>Huge and gaunt, with unblinking,
frosty gray eyes, looking more like
an arctic explorer than a man of
science, Matt towered over the average
man and carelessly dominated
any assembly by sheer force of
mentality. He even towered a little
over big Jim Holden now, as he
absently shook hands with him.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in," he said, his
voice vague. And to Denny: "I'm
busy as the devil, but you can
watch over my shoulder if you want
to. Got something new on. Great
thing&mdash;though I don't think it'll
have any practical meaning."</p>

<p>The two padded after him along
a dusty hallway, up a flight of
stairs that was little more than a
ladder, and into the cavernous loft
of the old barn which had been
transformed into a laboratory.</p>

<p>Jim drew Denny aside a pace or
two. "He says he's got something
new. Isn't he afraid to show it to
a stranger like me?"</p>

<p>"Afraid? Why should he be?"</p>

<p>"Well, ideas do get stolen now
and then, you know."</p>

<p>Denny smiled. "When Matt gets
hold of something new, you can be
sure the discovery isn't a new kind
of can-opener or patent towel-rack
that can be 'stolen.' His ideas are
safe for the simple reason that
there probably aren't more than
four other scientists on earth
capable of even dimly comprehending
them. All you and I can do&mdash;whatever
this may turn out to be&mdash;is
to watch and marvel."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Matt</span>, meanwhile, had lumbered
with awkward grace to
a great wooden pedestal. Cupping
down over this was a glass bell,
about eight feet high, suspended
from the roof.</p>

<p>Around the base of the pedestal
was a ring of big lamp-affairs, that
looked like a bank of flood-lights.
The only difference was that where
flood-lights would have had regular
glass lenses to transmit light beams,
these had thin plates of lead across
the openings. Thick copper conduits
branched to each from a big
dynamo.</p>

<p>Matt reached into a welter of
odds and ends on a bench, and
picked up a tube. Rather like an
ordinary electric light bulb, it
looked, save that there were no
filaments in the thin glass shell.
Where filaments should have been
there was a thin cylinder of bluish-gray
metal.</p>

<p>"Element number eighty-five,"
said Matt in his deep, abstracted
voice, pointing at the bluish cylinder.
"Located it about a year ago.
Last of the missing elements. Does
strange tricks when subjected to
heavy electric current. In each of
those things that look like searchlights
is one of these bulbs."</p>

<p>He laid down the extra tube,
turned toward a door in the near
wall, then turned back to his silent
guests again. Apparently he felt
they were due a little more enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Eighty-five isn't nearly as radioactive
as the elements akin to it,"
he said. Satisfied that he had now
explained everything, he started
again toward the door.</p>

<p>As he neared it, Dennis and Jim
heard a throaty growling, and a
vicious scratching on the wooden
panels. And as Matt opened the
door a big mongrel dog leaped savagely
at him!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Calmly</span>, Matt caught the brute
by the throat and held it away
from him at arm's length, seeming
hardly to be aware of its eighty-odd
pounds of struggling weight.
Into Jim's eyes crept a glint of
admiration. It was a feat of
strength as well as of animal management;
and, himself proficient in
both, Jim could accord tribute
where it was due.</p>

<p>"You came just as I was about
to try an experiment on the highest
form of life I've yet exposed to my
new rays," he said, striding easily
toward the glass bell with the
savage hound. "It's worked all right
with frogs and snakes&mdash;but will it
work with more complex creatures?
Mammalian creatures? That's a
question."</p>

<p>Denny forbore to ask him what
It did, how It worked, what the
devil It was, anyway. From his own
experience he knew that the abstraction
of an experimenter insulates
him from every outside
contact. Matt, he realized, was probably
making a great effort to remain
aware that they were there
in the laboratory at all; probably
thought he had explained in great
detail his new device and its
powers.</p>

<p>Vaguely wrapped in his fog of
concentration, Matt thrust the
snarling dog under the bell, which
he lowered quickly till it rested on
the pedestal-floor and ringed the
dog with a wall of glass behind
which it barked and growled soundlessly.</p>

<p>Completely preoccupied again,
Matt went to a big switch and
threw it. The dynamo hummed,
raised its pitch to a high, almost
intolerable keening note. The ring
of pseudo-searchlights seemed in
an ominous sort of way to spring
into life. The impression must have
been entirely imaginary; actually
the projectors didn't move in the
slightest, didn't even vibrate. Yet
the conviction persisted in the
minds of both Jim and Dennis that
some black, invisible force was
pouring down those conduits, to be
sifted, diffused, and hurled through
the lead lenses at the dog in the
bell.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Thrilled</span> to the core, not having
the faintest idea what it
was they were about to see, but
convinced that it must surely be of
stupendous import, the two stared
unwinkingly at the furious hound.
Matt was staring, too; but his
glance was almost casual, and was
concentrated more on the glass of
the bell than on the experimental
object.</p>

<p>The reason for the direction of
his gaze almost immediately became
apparent. And as the reason was
disclosed, Dennis and Jim exclaimed
aloud in disappointment&mdash;at
the same time, so intense was
their nameless suspense, not knowing
they had opened their mouths.
It appeared that for yet a little
while they were to remain in ignorance
of the precise meaning of
the experiment.</p>

<p>The glass of the bell was clouding.
A swirling, milky vapor, not
unlike fog, was filling the bell from
top to bottom.</p>

<p>The dog, rapidly being hidden
from sight by the gathering mist,
suddenly stopped its antics and stood
still in the center of the bell as
though overcome by surprise and
indecision. Motionless, staring
vacantly, it stood there for an instant&mdash;then
was concealed completely
by the rolling vapor.</p>

<p>But just before it disappeared,
Jim turned to Denny in astonishment,
to see if Denny had observed
what he had; namely, that the fog
seemed not to be gathering from the
air penned up in the bell, but in
some strange and rather awful way
to be exuding <i>from the body of the
dog itself</i>!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> two stared back at the bell
again, neither one sure he had
been right in his impression. But
now the glass was entirely opaque.
So thick was the vapor within that
it seemed on the point of turning
to a liquid. Inside, swathed in the
secrecy of the fleecy folds of mist&mdash;what
was happening to the dog?
The two men could only guess.</p>

<p>Matt glanced up at an electric
clock with an oversized second
hand. His fingers moved nervously
on the switch, then threw it to cut
contact. The dynamo keened its
dying note. A silence so tense that
it hurt filled the great laboratory.</p>

<p>All eyes were glued on the bell.</p>

<p>The thick vapor that had been
swirling and crowding as if to force
itself through the glass, grew less
restive in motion. Then it began to
rise, ever more slowly, toward the
top.</p>

<p>More and more compactly it
packed itself into the arched glass
dome, the top layers finally resembling
nothing so much as cloudy
beef gelatin. And now these top
layers were solidifying, clinging to
the glass.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bottom line of
the vapor was slowly rising, an inch
at a time, like a shimmering curtain
being raised from a stage floor.
At last ten inches showed between
the pedestal and the swaying bottom
of the almost liquid vapor.
Jim and Denny stooped to peer
under the blanket of cloud. The
dog! In what way had it been affected?</p>

<p>Again they exclaimed aloud, involuntarily,
unconsciously.</p>

<p>There was no dog to be seen.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">With</span> about fourteen clear
inches now exposed, they
looked a second time, more intently.
But their first glance had been
right. The dog was gone from the
bell. Utterly and completely vanished!
Or so, at least, they thought
at the moment.</p>

<p>The rising and solidifying process
of the vapor went on, while
Dennis and Jim stood, almost incapable
of movement, and watched
to see what Breen was going to do
next.</p>

<p>His next move came in about
four minutes, when the crowding
vapor had at last completely come
to rest at the top of the dome like
a deposit of opaque jelly. He
stepped to the windlass that raised
the bell, and turned the handle.</p>

<p>Immediately the two watchers
strode impulsively toward the exposed
pedestal floor.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," commanded the
scientist, his eyes sparkling with
almost ferocious intensity. The two
stopped. "You might step on it,"
he added, amazingly.</p>

<p>He caught up a common glass
water tumbler, and cautiously
moved to the edge of the platform.
"It may be dead, of course," he
muttered. "But I might as well
be prepared."</p>

<p>Wonderingly, Jim and Dennis
saw that he was intently searching
every square inch of the pedestal
flooring. Then they saw him crawl,
like a stalking cat, toward a portion
near the center&mdash;saw him clap
the tumbler, upside down, over
some unseen thing....</p>

<p>"Got him!" came Matt's deep,
fuzzy voice. "And he isn't dead,
either. Not by a long way! Now
we'll get a magnifying glass and
study him."</p>

<p>Feeling like figures in a dream,
Jim and Dennis looked through the
lens with their absorbed host.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Capering</span> about under the inverted
tumbler, like a four-legged
bug&mdash;and not a very large
bug, either&mdash;was an incredible
thing. A thing with a soft, furry
coat such as no true insect possesses.
A thing with tiny, canine
jaws, from which hung a panting
speck of a tongue like no bug ever
had.</p>

<p>"Yes," rumbled Matt, "the specimen
is far indeed from being dead.
I don't know how long it might
exist in so microscopic a state, nor
whether it has been seriously deranged,
body or brain, by the diminishing
process. But at least&mdash;it's
alive."</p>

<p>"My God!" whispered Dennis.
And, his first coherent sentence
since the physicist had thrown the
switch: "So this&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;is the overgrown
brute you put under the bell
a few minutes ago! This eighth-of-an-inch
thing that is a miniature
cartoon of a dog!"</p>

<p>Jim could merely stare from the
tumbler and the marvel it walled
in, to the man who had worked the
miracle, and back to the tumbler
again.</p>

<p>Denny sighed. "That thick, jellylike
substance in the top of the
bell," he said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that." The miracle worker
didn't lift his eyes from the tumbler
and the very much alive and
protesting bit of life it housed.
"That's the dog. Rather, it's practically
all of the dog save for this
small residue of substance that
clothes the vital life-spark."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jim</span> dabbed at his forehead and
found it moist with sweat. "But
how is it done?" he said shakily.</p>

<p>"With element eighty-five, as I
told you," said Breen, most of
whose attention was occupied by a
new stunt he was trying: he had
cut a microscopic sliver of meat off
a gnawed bone, and was sliding it
under the glass. Would the dog
eat? Could it...?</p>

<p>It could, and would! With a
mighty bound, that covered all of a
quarter of an inch, the tiny thing
leaped on the meat and began to
gnaw wolfishly at it. The effect was
doubly shocking&mdash;to see this perfect
little creature acting like any
regular, full-sized dog, although as
tiny as a woman's beauty spot!</p>

<p>"Marvelous stuff, eighty-five,"
Matt went on. "Any living thing,
exposed to the lead-filtered emanations
it gives off when disintegrated
electrically to precisely the
right degree, is reduced indefinitely
in size. I could have made that dog
as small as a microbe, even sub-visible
perhaps, if I chose.
Curious.... Maybe the presence
of eighty-five in minute quantities
on earth is all that has kept every
living thing from growing indefinitely,
expanding gigantically right
off the face of the globe...."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> now Dennis was hardly
listening to him. A notion so
fantastic, so bizarre that he could
not at once grasp it fully, had just
struck him.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said at last, his voice
so hoarse as to be almost unrecognizable,
"listen&mdash;can you reverse
that process?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded, and pointed to the
viscous deposit in the dome of the
bell. "The protoplasmic substance
is still there. It can be rebuilt, remolded
to its original form any
time I put the dog back in the bell
and let the particles of eighty-five,
which are suspended in the vacuum
tubes, settle back into their original,
inert mass. You see, there is
such a close affinity&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dennis cut him short almost
rudely. It wasn't causes, marvelous
though they might be, that he was
interested in; it was results.</p>

<p>"Would you dare ... that is ...
would you like to try that experiment
on a human being?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now</span> for once the inventor's
entire interest was seized by
something outside his immediate
work. He stared open-mouthed at
Dennis.</p>

<p>"Would I?" he breathed. "Would
I like ..." He grunted. "Such a
question! No experiment is complete
till man, the highest form of
all life, has been subjected to it.
I'd give anything for the chance!"
He sighed explosively. "But of
course that's impossible. I could
never get anyone to be a subject.
And I can't have it tried on myself
because I'm the only one able to
handle my apparatus in the event
that anything goes wrong."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;would you try it on a human
being if you had a chance?"
persisted Denny.</p>

<p>"Hah!"</p>

<p>"And could you reduce a human
being in stature as radically as you
did the dog? For example, could
you make a man ... ant-size?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded vigorously, eyes
fairly flaming. "I could make him
even smaller."</p>

<p>Dennis stared at Jim. His face
was transfigured. He shook with
nervous eagerness. And Jim gazed
back at Dennis as breathlessly and
as tensely.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Dennis at last.</p>

<p>Jim nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Of course."</p>

<p>And in those few words two men
were committed to what was perhaps
the strangest, most deadly, and
surely the most unique, adventure
the world has yet known. The
improbable had happened. A man
who lived but for dangers and extraordinary
action, and a man who
would have gambled his soul for
the scientist's ecstasy of at last
learning all about a hidden study&mdash;both
had seen suddenly open up to
them a broad avenue leading to the
very pinnacle of their dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<i>Ant-Sized Men</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Next</span> morning, at scarcely
more than daybreak, Jim and
Denny stood, stripped and ready
for the dread experiment, beside
Matthew Breen's glass bell. The
night, of course, had been sleepless.
Sleep? How could slumber combat
the fierce anticipations, the exotic
imaginings, the clanging apprehensions
of the two?</p>

<p>Most of the night had been spent
by Denny in dutifully arguing with
Jim about the advisability of his
giving up the adventure, in soothing
his conscience by presenting in
all the angles he could think of the
risks they would run.</p>

<p>"You'll be entering a different
world, Jim," Denny had said. "An
unimaginably different world. A
terrible world, in which you'll be
a naked, soft, defenseless thing. I'd
hate to bet that we'd live even to
reach the termitary. And once inside
that&mdash;it's odds of seven to one
that we'll never get out again."</p>

<p>"Stow it," Jim had urged, puffing
at his pipe.</p>

<p>"I won't stow it. You may think
you've run up against dangers before,
but let me tell you that your
most perilous jungle is safe as a
church compared to the jungle an
ordinary grass plot will present to
us, if, as we plan, we get reduced
to a quarter of an inch. I'm going
in this with a mission. To me it's
a heaven-sent opportunity&mdash;one I'm
sure any entomologist would grab
at. But you, frankly, are just a
fool&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," Jim had cut in, "let
it go at that. I'm confirmed in my
folly. You can't argue me out of it,
so don't try any more. Now, to be
practical&mdash;have you thought of any
way we could arm ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Arm ourselves?" repeated Dennis
vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's a difficult problem. The
finest watch-maker couldn't turn
out a working model of a gun that
could be handled by a man a quarter
of an inch tall. At the same time
I have no desire to go into this
thing bare-handed. And I think I
know something we can use."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Spears," said Jim with a grin.
"Steel spears. They make steel wire,
you know, down to two-thousandths
of an inch and finer. Probably our
friend has some in his laboratory.
Now, if we grind two pieces about
a quarter of an inch long off such
a wire, and sharpen the ends as well
as we can, we'll have short spears
we could swing very well.</p>

<p>"Then, there's the matter of
clothes." He grinned again. "We'll
want a breech clout, at least. I propose
that we get the sheerest silk
gauze we can find, and cut an
eighth-inch square apiece to tie
about our middles after the transformation."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> slapped his fist into his
palm. "By George! Such talk
really begins to bring it home. Two
men, clad in eighth-inch squares of
silk gauze, using bits of almost invisibly
fine steel wire as weapons,
junketing forth into a world in
which they'll be about the smallest
and puniest things in sight! No
more lords of creation, Denny.
We'll have nothing but our wits to
carry us through. But they, of
course, will be supreme in the insect
world as they are in the animal
world."</p>

<p>"Will they be supreme?" Denny
said softly. That unknown intelligence&mdash;that
mysterious intellect
(super-termite?) that seemed to
rule each termite tribe, and which
appeared so marvelously profound!
"I wonder...."</p>

<p>Then he, in his turn, had descended
to the practical.</p>

<p>"You've solved the problem of
weapons and clothing, Jim," he said,
"and now for my contribution." He
left the room and came back in a
few minutes with something in his
hands. "Here are some shields for
us.</p>

<p>"Oh, not pieces of steel armor.
Shields in a figurative more than a
literal sense."</p>

<p>He set down a small porcelain
pot, and opened it. Within was a
repulsive-looking, whitish-brown
paste.</p>

<p>"Ground-up termites," he explained.
"If we're to go wandering
around in a termitary, we've got
to persuade the inmates that we're
friends, not foes. So we'll smear
ourselves all over with this termite-paste
before ever we enter the
mound."</p>

<p>"Clever, these supposedly impractical
scientists," murmured Jim,
with a lightness that did not quite
succeed in covering his real admiration
of the shrewdness of the
thought.</p>

<p>And now they stood in front of
Breen's glass bell, with Breen beside
them all eagerness to begin
the experiment.</p>

<p>"What am I supposed to do after
I've reduced you to the proper
size?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Take us out to Morton's Grove,
to the big termitary you'll find
about a quarter of a mile off the
road," said Denny. "Set us down
near the opening to one of the
larger termite tunnels. Then wait
till we come out again. You may
have to wait quite a while&mdash;but
that isn't much to ask in return for
our submission to your rays."</p>

<p>"I'll wait a week, if you wish.
Let's see, what had I better carry
you in?"</p>

<p>It was decided&mdash;with a lack of
forethought later to be bitterly regretted&mdash;that
an ordinary patty-dish
of the kind in which restaurants
serve butter, would make as
good a conveyance as anything else.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Matt</span> got the patty-dish and
placed it on the pedestal
floor, tipping it on edge so Jim and
Denny would be able to climb into
it unaided (he wouldn't dare attempt
to lift bodies so small for
fear of mortally injuring them between
thumb and forefinger). Into
the patty-dish, so they could be
readily located, were placed the bits
of wire, the tiny fragments of silk
gauze to serve as breech clouts, and
a generous dab of termite-paste;
and the two men stepped inside the
glass dome to share the fate that,
the night before, had been the
dog's.</p>

<p>The bell was lowered around
them. They watched the inventor
step to the switch and pull it
down....</p>

<p>At first there was no sensation
whatever. Almost with incredulity,
they watched the glass walls cloud,
realized that the fogging vapor was
formed of exudations from their
own substance. Then physical reaction
set in.</p>

<p>The first symptom was paralysis.
With the vapor wreathing their
heads in dense clouds, they found
themselves unable to move a muscle.
The paralysis spread partially to
the involuntary muscles. Heart
action was retarded enormously;
and they ceased almost entirely to
breathe. In spite of the cessation
of muscular functioning, however,
they were still conscious in a vague
way. Conscious enough, at all
events, to go through a hell of
agony when&mdash;second and last stage&mdash;every
nerve in their bodies
seemed of a sudden to be rasped
with files, and every tiny particle
of their flesh jerked and twitched
as if to break loose from the ever-shrinking
skin.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Time</span>, of course, was completely
lost sight of. It might have
been ten hours, or five minutes later
when they realized they were still
alive, still standing on their own
feet, and now able to breathe and
move. The spell of rigidity had
been broken; nerves and muscles
functioned smoothly and painlessly
again. Also they were in clear air.</p>

<p>"I guess the experiment didn't
work," Dennis began unsteadily.
But then, as his eyes began to get
accustomed to his fantastically new,
though intrinsically unchanged surroundings,
he cried aloud.</p>

<p>The experiment <i>had</i> worked. No
doubt of that! And they were in a
world where all the old familiar
things were new and incredible
marvels.</p>

<p>"What can be the nature of this
stuff we're standing on?" wondered
Jim, looking down.</p>

<p>Following his gaze, Denny too
wondered for an instant, till realization
came to him. "Why, it's ordinary
wood! Just the wood of the
pedestal platform!"</p>

<p>But it didn't seem like wood. The
grain stood out in knee-high ridges
in all directions to the limit of visibility.
It was like a nightmare picture
of a frozen bad-lands, split
here and there by six-feet-broad,
unfathomable chasms&mdash;which were
the cracks in the flooring.</p>

<p>"Where's the patty-dish?" queried
Jim.</p>

<p>Dennis gazed about. "We were
standing right over it when the reducing
process started.... Oh,
there it is!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Far</span> off to the right an enormous,
shallowly hollowed plateau
caught their eyes. They started
toward it, hurdling the irregular
ridges, leaping across the dizzy
chasms.</p>

<p>The tiny dish had been tipped
on edge&mdash;but when they reached it
they found its thickness alone a
daunting thing.</p>

<p>"It's a pity Matt didn't select a
thinner kind of china," grumbled
Dennis; gazing at the head-high
wall that was the edge of the plate.
"Here&mdash;I'll stand on your shoulders,
and then give you an arm up. Look
out&mdash;it's slippery!"</p>

<p>It was. Their feet slid out from
under them on the glazed surface
repeatedly. It was with the utmost
effort that they finally made their
way to the center of the shallow
plateau.</p>

<p>There, lying beside two heaps of
coarse cloth and a mound of horrible-smelling
stuff that he recognized
as the dab of termite-paste,
they saw two glistening steel bars.
About five feet long, they seemed
to be, and half an inch in diameter.
The wire-ends which, a few
moments ago, they had been forced
to handle with tweezers for fear of
losing!</p>

<p>Jim picked one up and drew it
back for a pretended spear-thrust.
He laughed, vibrantly, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I'm just beginning to realize it's
really happened, and that the hunt
has started. Bring on your bugs!"</p>

<p>Dennis stooped and picked up
his spear. It was unwieldy, ponderous,
the weight of that long,
not-too-thin steel bar. Jim's great
shoulders and heavy arms were
suited well enough to such a weapon;
but Dennis could have wished
that his were some pounds lighter.</p>

<p>They turned their attention to
the evil-smelling hill of termite-ointment.
With many grimaces,
they took turns in smearing each
other from head to feet with the
repulsive stuff. Then they knotted
about them the yard-square pieces
of fabric&mdash;once sheer silk gauze,
now cloth as stiff and cumbersome
as sail-cloth. They faced each other,
ready for their trip.</p>

<p>The heavens above them, trailing
up and up into mysterious darknesses,
suddenly became closer and
sparkled with a diamond sheen.
Stretching off and up out of sight
was a mountainous column that
might conceivably be a wrist.</p>

<p>"Matt's looking at us through a
magnifying glass," concluded
Denny.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Abruptly</span> the ridged bad-lands
about them began to vibrate.
Thunder crashed and roared
around their ears.</p>

<p>"He's trying to say something to
us," said Denny, when the awful
din had ceased. "Oh, Matt&mdash;we're
ready to go!"</p>

<p>Jim echoed his shout. Then
Denny snorted. "Fools! Our voices
are probably pitched way above the
limit of audibility. He can't hear us
any more than we can understand
him!"</p>

<p>They gazed at each other. More
than anything else that had happened,
this showed them how entirely
they were cut off from their
old world. Truly, in discarding
their normal size, they might as
well have been marooned on another
planet!</p>

<p>A tremendous, pinkish-gray wall
lowered near them, split into segments,
and surrounded their plateau.
The plateau was lifted&mdash;with
a dizzy swiftness that made their
stomachs turn.</p>

<p>With sickening speed the plateau
moved forward. The texture of the
heavens above them changed. The
sun&mdash;the one thing in their new
universe that seemed unchanged in
size and aspect&mdash;shone down on
them. The plateau came jarringly
to rest. Great cliffs of what seemed
black basalt gleamed high over
them.</p>

<p>Matt had carried them out of the
building, and had set the patty-dish
on the black leather seat of
his automobile.</p>

<p>There was a distant thundering,
as though all the worlds in the
universe but Earth were being
dashed to pieces. That was the motor
starting. And then, as the car
moved off, Jim and Dennis realized
their mistake in choosing a patty-dish
to ride in!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> spite of the yielding leather
cushion on which their dish was
set, the two quarter-inch men were
hurled this way and that, jounced
horribly up and down, and slid
headlong from one end of the plateau
to the other as the automobile
passed over the city streets. Impossible
to stand. They could only
crouch low on the hard glazed surface,
and try to keep from breaking
legs and arms in the worst earthquake
it is possible to imagine. Anyone
who has ever seen two bugs
ill-advisedly try to walk across the
vibrating hood of an automobile
while the motor is running, will
have some idea of the troubles that
now beset Dennis and Jim.</p>

<p>"The ass!" groaned Jim, in a comparatively
quiet spell. "Why doesn't
he drive more carefully?"</p>

<p>"Probably," groaned Denny,
"he's doing the best he can."</p>

<p>Probably! All that was left them
was conjecture. They could only
guest at what was happening in the
world about them!</p>

<p>Matthew Breen's face and body
were lost in sheer immensity above
them. They knew they were riding
in a car; but they couldn't see the
car. All they could see was the
black cliff that was the seat-cushion
behind them. The world had disappeared&mdash;hidden
in its bigness; the
world, indeed, was just at present
a patty-dish.</p>

<p>Somehow they endured the ride.
Somehow they avoided broken
bones, and were only shaken up and
bruised when the distant roar of
the motor ceased and the wind
stopped howling about their ears.</p>

<p>"Well, we're here," said Dennis
unsteadily. "Now for the real&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words were stopped by the
sudden rising of the plateau. Again
they felt the poignantly exaggerated,
express-elevator feeling,
till the plateau finally came to rest.</p>

<p>The crashing thunder of Matt's
voice came to them, words utterly
indistinguishable. The saucer was
tipped sideways....</p>

<p>Doubtless Matt thought he was
acting with extreme gentleness; but
in fact the dish was tilted so
quickly and so without warning
that Jim and Dennis slid from its
center, head over heels, to fall over
the edge and land with a bump on
the ground. Their spears, sliding
after, narrowly missed impaling
them.</p>

<p>Once more came the distant
crashing of Matt's voice. Then there
was silence. Their gigantic protector,
having dumped them unceremoniously
into the grass of Morton's
Grove, had ushered them
squarely into the start of their insane
adventure. From now on their
fate belonged to them alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<i>The Raid</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Bewilderedly</span>, they looked
around them.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, barely to be seen
for the trunks of giant trees intervening,
was a smoothly-rounded
mountain. Majestic and aloof it
soared, dwarfing all near it&mdash;the
termitary which, yesterday, had
been but waist-high. There was
their eventual goal; but meanwhile
their immediate surroundings roused
their greater interest&mdash;and all their
alertness!</p>

<p>When Dennis had said they
would find a common grass plot a
wild and exotic jungle, he had
spoken perhaps more truly than he
knew. At any rate, the jungle they
now found themselves in was something
to exceed man's wildest
dreams.</p>

<p>Far over their heads towered a
wilderness of trees. But such trees!
Without branches, shooting up and
over in graceful, tangling curves,
their trunks oddly flat and ribbonlike
and yellow-green. It was impossible
to look on them as grass
stems.</p>

<p>Here and there the trees had
fallen, presenting a tangled wilderness
of leathery, five-foot-wide
strips. Webs of roots, tough and
gnarled, whitish in color, curled in
all directions to catch the feet and
baffle the eye. It was an appalling
underbrush. And it was an underbrush,
moreover, in which there was
plenty of wild life!</p>

<p>A hairy, pulpy thing, reddish in
color, with gauzy wings and a
myriad flashing eyes scuttled close
to them as though drawn by
curiosity to inspect them. As big as
an eagle it appeared to them; both
grasped their spears; but soon, with
a wild whistle of its wings, it rose
up through the tangle of underbrush
and hummed off. A fruit fly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">And</span> now a monstrous thing appeared
far off, to stalk like a
balloon on twenty-foot legs in their
direction. With incredible quickness
it loomed over them. Six feet
through, its body was roughly
spherical, and carried on those
amazingly long, jointed legs. It
stared at them with beady, cruel
eyes, but finally teetered on its way
again, leaving them untouched.</p>

<p>"I'll never again be able to see
a daddy longlegs without shivering,"
said Jim. His voice was unconsciously
sunk to little more than
a whisper. This was a world of titanic
dangers and fierce alarms. Instinct
cautioned both of them to
make no more noise than necessary.
"We had better make for your termitary
at once."</p>

<p>Dennis had been thinking that
for some time. But he had been unable
to locate a termite tunnel anywhere.
Matt had been supposed to
set them down near one. No doubt,
to his own mind, he <i>had</i> placed
them near one of the termite highways.
But his ideas of distance
were now so radically different
from theirs that Dennis, at least,
was unable to see a tunnel opening
anywhere.</p>

<p>He spoke his thoughts to Jim.
"There must be a tunnel opening
somewhere very near us," he concluded.
"But I&mdash;Good heavens!"</p>

<p>Both crouched in wary alarm,
spears held for a thrust, if necessary,
at the frightful thing approaching
them from the near jungle.</p>

<p>Thirty feet long, it was, and six
feet through, a blunt-ended, untapered
serpent that glistened a moist
crimson color in the rays of the
sun. The trees quaked and rocked
as it brushed against them in its
deliberate advance. Dead leaves
many feet across and too heavy
for the combined efforts of both
men to have budged, were pushed
lightly this way and that as the
monster moved. The very ground
seemed to shake under its appalling
weight.</p>

<p>"If <i>that</i> comes after us," breathed
Jim, "we're through!"</p>

<p>But now Denny drew a long
breath of relief.</p>

<p>"Be still," he said. "Make no
sound, and no move, and it will
probably pass us by. It's blind, and
couldn't harm us in any way&mdash;unless
it rolled on us."</p>

<p>The two stood motionless while
the nightmare serpent crashed by.
Then, with the earthworm fading
into the distance, they resumed
their hunt for the near tunnel entrance.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jim</span>, whose eyes were more accustomed
to searching jungle
depths, finally saw it&mdash;a black hole
leading down into a small hill about
two hundred yards ahead of them.
He pointed.</p>

<p>"There we are. Come on."</p>

<p>Laboriously they set out toward
it. Laboriously because at every step
some almost insuperable hurdle
barred their way. A fallen grass
stalk was a problem; sometimes
they had to curve back on their
tracks for sixty or eighty feet in
order to get around it. A dead leaf,
drifted there from the trees near
at hand, was almost a calamity,
necessitating more circuitous maneuvering.</p>

<p>With every yard the realization
of the stark peril that was now
theirs increased.</p>

<p>A grasshopper, blundering to the
ground within a rod of them, nearly
crushed them with its several tons
of weight. A bumblebee, as big as
a flying elephant and twice as
deadly, roared around them for several
minutes as though debating
whether or not to attack them, and
finally roared off leaving them
shaken and pale. But the most
startling and narrow of their narrow
escapes occurred an instant
after that.</p>

<p>They had paused for an instant,
alert but undecided, to stare at a
coldly glaring spider that was
barring their path. It was a small
spider, barely more than waist-high.
But something in its malevolent
eyes made the two men hesitate
about attacking it. At the same time
it was squatting in the only clear
path in sight, with tangles of stalks
and leaves on either side. A journey
around the ferocious brute might be
a complicated, long-drawn-out affair.</p>

<p>Their problem was decided for
them.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Overhead</span>, suddenly roared
out a sound such as might
have been made by a tri-motored
Fokker. There was a flash of yellow.
The roar increased to an ear-shattering
scream. Something
swooped so breathlessly and at the
same time so ponderously that the
men were knocked flat by the hurricane
of disturbed air.</p>

<p>A fleeting struggle ensued between
some vast yellow body and
the unfortunate spider. Then the
spider, suddenly as immobile as a
lump of stone, was drawn up into
the heavens by the roaring yellow
thing, and disappeared. A wasp had
struck, and had obtained another
meal.</p>

<p>"Thank God that thing had a
one-track mind, and was concentrating
on the spider," said Jim,
with a rather humorless laugh.</p>

<p>Dennis was silent. He was beginning
to realize that he knew
too much about insects for his
peace of mind. To Jim, insects had
always heretofore been something
to brush away or step on, as the circumstance
might indicate. He had
no idea, for example, of exactly
what fate it was he had just missed.
But Denny knew all about it.</p>

<p>He knew that if the wasp had
chosen either of them, the chosen
one would have felt a stabbing
thing like a red-hot sword penetrate
to his vitals. He knew that
swift paralysis would have followed
the thrust. He knew that then the
victim would have been taken back,
helpless and motionless as the
spider was, to be laid side by side
with other helpless but still conscious
victims in the fetid depths
of the wasp's nest. And he knew
that finally an egg would have been
laid on the victim's chest; an egg
that would eventually hatch and deliver
a bit of life that would calmly
and leisurely devour the paralyzed
food supply alive.</p>

<p>"Let's hurry," he suggested,
glancing up to see if any more
wasps were hovering about.</p>

<p>The lowering tunnel mouth was
very near now. Barely twenty yards
away. What with the crowding
monsters around them, the tunnel
began to look like a haven. Almost
at a run, they continued toward
it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Then</span> a commotion like that
which might be made by a
mighty army sounded in the underbrush
behind them. Dennis looked
back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" he gasped, suddenly accelerating
his pace into frank flight.
"Ants...."</p>

<p>Jim glanced back, too&mdash;and joined
Denny in his flight. Pouring toward
them at express train speed,
flinging aside fallen stalks, climbing
over obstructions as though no obstructions
were there, was coming
a grim and armored horde. Far in
the lead, probably the one that had
seen the men first and started the
deadly chase, was a single ant.</p>

<p>The solitary leader was a monster
of its kind. As tall as Jim,
clashing in its horny armor, it
rushed toward the fugitives.</p>

<p>"It's going to reach the tunnel
before we do," Jim panted. "We've
got to kill the thing&mdash;and do it
before the rest get to us...."</p>

<p>The monster was on them.
Blindly, ferociously it hurled its
bulk at the things that smelled like
termites however little they resembled
them. The termite-paste
was, in this instance, the most
deadly of challenges.</p>

<p>Jim stepped to the fore, with his
spear point slanted to receive the
onslaught, spear butt grounded at
his feet.</p>

<p>Whether the six-legged horror
would have had wit enough to comprehend
the nature of the defense
offered, and would have striven to
circumvent it, had time been given
it, is a question that will never be
answered. For the thing wasn't
given the time.</p>

<p>In mid-air it seemed to writhe
and try to change the direction of
its leap. But it was on the point
and had transfixed itself before its
intelligence, however keen, could
have functioned.</p>

<p>The fight, though, was by no
means over. With five feet of steel
piercing it through, it whirled with
hardly abated vitality toward Dennis.
Its gargoyle head came close
and closer.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dennis</span> sprang sideways along
its length, lifted the pointed
bar he held, and dashed it down on
what looked to him a vital spot&mdash;the
unbelievably slender trunk that
held its spatulate abdomen to its
armored chest.</p>

<p>There was a crack as the bar
smashed down on the weak point.
The monster sank quivering to the
ground. An instant later it was up,
but now its movements were dazed
and sluggish as it dragged its half-paralyzed
abdomen after it, and
fumbled and caught on the heavy
bar that transfixed it.</p>

<p>Jim caught the bar and tugged it.
"My spear!" he cried. "Denny&mdash;help!"</p>

<p>Together the two wrenched to
jerk the spear loose from the horny
armor of the dying ant. The rest
of the pack were very near now.</p>

<p>"We'll have to let it go...."
panted Denny.</p>

<p>But at that instant their desperate
efforts tore it loose from the
convulsively jerking hulk. They
darted into the tunnel mouth with
the racing horde scarcely twenty
yards behind them.</p>

<p>Without hesitation the ants
poured in after them. Jim and
Dennis leaped forward, in pitch
darkness, now and then bumping
heavily against a wall as the tunnel
turned, but having at least no
trouble with their footing: the floor
was as smooth as though man-made.</p>

<p>Behind them they could hear the
armored horde crashing along in the
blackness. The smashing noise of
their progress was growing louder.
The two had run perhaps fifty
yards in the darkness. Another
fifty, and they would be caught!</p>

<p>But now, just as their eyes&mdash;sharpened
also by the danger they
were in&mdash;began to grow accustomed
to the gloom, they saw ahead of
them a thing that might have stepped
straight out of a horrible dream.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Six</span> feet of vulnerable, unarmored
body, amply protected
by horny head and shoulders and
ten feet of awful, scissor-mandibles,
faced them. The creature was doing
a strange sort of war dance, swaying
its terrible bulk back and forth
rhythmically, while its feet remained
immovable. An instant it
did this, then it charged at the
two men. Simultaneously the crashing
of the fierce horde behind
sounded with appalling nearness&mdash;the
noise and odor of the ants preventing
the huge termite guard in
front of the men from recognizing
and approving the smell of the
termite-paste that covered their
bodies.</p>

<p>"Follow me!" snapped Denny, remembering
that the hideous attacking
thing before them was
blind, and gaining from that knowledge
swift inspiration.</p>

<p>Jim gathered his muscles to follow
at command. But he almost
shouted aloud as he saw Denny
leap&mdash;straight toward the enormous,
snapping mandibles.</p>

<p>In an instant, however, Denny's
idea was made clear. With a slide
that would have done credit to any
baseball player, the entomologist
catapulted on his chest past the
snapping peril. Jim followed, with
not a foot to spare. They were not
past the soft rear-parts of the thing,
but they were at least past its horrible
jaws. And before the monster
could turn its unwieldy bulk in the
tunnel, the ants were upon it.</p>

<p>For a few seconds, blinded to
their own danger by the fascination
of the struggle going on before
them, the two men witnessed the
grim watcher of the tunnel as it
drove back wave after wave of attacking
ants.</p>

<p>Two at a time, the invaders
charged that wall of living horn.
And two at a time they were swept
against the walls, or slashed in two
by the enormous mandibles. One
against an army; but it was a full
minute or so before the one began
to weaken.</p>

<p>"Come," whispered Dennis, at
last. "If what I think is going to
happen occurs, this will be no place
for us."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> went ahead, with the din
of battle dying behind them,
till they saw a small tunnel branching
off beside the main stem. Into
this they squeezed. But as Jim
started to go farther down its constricted
length, Dennis stopped him.</p>

<p>"We're fairly safe here, I think.
We'll stay and watch...."</p>

<p>Silently, motionless, they lurked
in the entrance of the side-avenue,
and peered out at the main avenue
they had just left. And now that
avenue began to buzz with traffic.</p>

<p>First, more of the horrors with
the enormous scissor-mandibles began
to stream past them. In twos
and threes, then in whole squads,
they lumbered by, bound for the ant
army that had invaded their sanctum.</p>

<p>Not quite too far ahead to be out
of sight, the defenders halted. Several
of their number went forward
to help the dying Horatius. The
rest lined up in a triple row across
a wide patch in the tunnel, presenting
a phalanx it would appear that
nothing could beat.</p>

<p>"How do they know enough to
gather here from distant parts of
this hollow mountain?" whispered
Jim to Denny. "How do they know
their city is besieged just at this
spot, and that their help is needed?"</p>

<p>Dennis shrugged. His eyes were
shining. This was the kind of thing
he had come here for. This unhampered
observation of a strange and
terrible race at war and at work&mdash;it
was well worth all the personal
risks he might run.</p>

<p>"No man can answer your question,
Jim. They're blind&mdash;they can't
see their danger so as to know how
to combat it. They couldn't hear,
and be alarmed by, the vibrations of
battle for a distance of more than
a few yards. My only guess is that
they are constantly and silently
commanded by the unknown intelligence,
the ruling brain, that hides
deep in the earth beneath us and
directs these 'soldier' termites in
some marvelous way&mdash;though itself
never seeing or hearing the actual
dangers it guards against."</p>

<p>"The queen?" suggested Jim.</p>

<p>Again Denny shrugged. "Who
knows? She might be the brains,
as well as the egg layer, of the
tribe. But don't talk too much. The
vibration of our voices might lead
them to us in spite of their blindness."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now</span> the main avenue before
them was humming with a
new kind of traffic. From side to
side it was being filled with a new
sort of termite. These were smaller
than the soldiers, and entirely unprotected
by either horn armor
plate or slashing mandibles.</p>

<p>Each of these carried an unwieldy
block of gleaming substance.
And each in turn dropped its block
in a growing wall behind the savage
defenders against the ants, and
fastened it in place with a thick
and viscous brown liquid that dried
almost immediately into a kind of
cement.</p>

<p>"The workers," whispered Dennis,
enthralled. "The building blocks are
half-digested wood. The cement is
a sort of stuff that exudes from
their own bodies. In ten minutes
there will be a wall across the
tunnel that no ants on earth could
penetrate!"</p>

<p>"But the home guards, the brave
lads and all that sort of thing, will
be shut off on the outside of the
wall with the enemy. And there
are hundreds of the enemy," protested
Jim.</p>

<p>"A necessary sacrifice," said
Denny. "And so perfect is their organization
that no one, including
the soldiers to be sacrificed, ever
makes any objection."</p>

<p>Jim shivered a little. "It's terrible,
somehow. It's&mdash;it's inhuman!"</p>

<p>"Naturally. It's insectian, if there
is such a word. And a wise man
once predicted that the termite organization,
being so much more perfect
a one than man's, indicated
the kind of society man would at
some time build up for himself. In
ten or twelve more centuries we,
too, might go off in millions and deliberately
starve to death because
the ruling power decided there
were too many people on earth.
We, too, might devour our dead because
it was essential not to let
anything go to waste. We, too,
might control our births so that
we produced astronomers with telescopes
in their heads instead of
regular eyes, carpenters with hammer
and saw instead of hands, soldiers
with poison gas sacs in their
chests so they could breathe death
and destruction at will. It would
be the perfect state of society."</p>

<p>"Maybe&mdash;but I'm glad I'll be dead
before that times comes," said Jim
with another shiver.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">By</span> now the wall ahead of them
was complete. On the other
side of it the soldier termites stolidly
fought on to their certain
death. On the near side, the workers
retreated to unknown depths in
the great hollow mountain behind
them. The main avenue was once
more clear, and, save for a few
workers hastening on unknown errands,
deserted.</p>

<p>"That act's over," sighed Dennis.
"But it may well be no more
than a curtain raiser to the acts to
come. Shall we be on our way?
We're hardly on the fringe of the
termitary yet&mdash;and I want to get
at the heart of it, and into the
depths far beneath it. Depths of
hell, we'll probably find them, Jim.
But a marvelous hell, and one no
man has ever before seen."</p>

<p>They left their little haven and
moved along the main tunnel toward
the heart of the termitary,
walking easily upright in this tunnel
which was only one of many
hundreds in the vast, hollowed
mountain&mdash;which loomed into the
outer sunshine to almost a height
of a yard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<i>Trapped</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On</span> along the tunnel they went.
And as they progressed, Dennis
got the answer to something
that had troubled him a great deal
before their entrance here&mdash;a problem
which had been solved, rather
amazingly, of itself.</p>

<p>Termitaries, as far as the entomologist
knew, were pitch-black
places which no ray of light ever
entered. He had been afraid he
would be forced to stumble blindly
in unlit depths, able to see nothing
at all, on a par with the blind
creatures among whom he moved.
Yet he and Jim could see in this
subterranean labyrinth.</p>

<p>He observed now the reason for
that. The walls on all sides, made
of half-digested cellulose, had
rotted just enough through long
years to be faintly phosphorescent.
And that simple natural fact was
probably going to mean all the difference
between life and death: it
gave the two men at least the advantage
of sight over the eyeless
savage creatures among whom,
helped by the termite-smell given
by the paste, they hoped to glide
unnoticed.</p>

<p>However, even the termite-paste,
and the fact that the termitary citizens
were blind, didn't seem enough
to account for the immunity granted
the two men as they began to come
presently to more crowded passages
and tunnels near the center of the
mound.</p>

<p>On every side of them now, requiring
the utmost in agility to
keep from actually brushing against
them, were hordes of the worker
termites, and dozens of the frightful
soldiers. Yet on the two men
moved, ever more slowly, without
one of the monsters attempting to
touch them. It was odd&mdash;almost uncanny.</p>

<p>"Surely the noise of our walking,
tiptoe as we may, must be
heard by them&mdash;and noted as different
from theirs," whispered Dennis.
"Yet they pay no attention to
us. If it is due to the paste, I must
say it's wonderful stuff!"</p>

<p>Jim nodded in a puzzled way.
"It's almost as if they wanted to
make our inward path easy. I wonder&mdash;if
it's going to be different
when we try to get out again!"</p>

<p>Dennis was wondering that, too.
It seemed absurd to suspect the
things of being intelligent enough
to lay traps. But it did look almost
as though they were encouraging
their two unheard-of visitors from
another world to go on deeper and
deeper into the heart of the eerie
city (all the tunnels sloped down
now), there perhaps to meet with
some ghastly imprisonment.</p>

<p>He gave it up. Sufficient for the
moment that they were unmolested,
and that he had a chance at first
hand to make observations more
complete than the world of entomology
had ever dreamed of.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> stumbled onto what
seemed a death struggle between
one of the giant soldiers and
an inoffensive-looking worker. The
drab, comparatively feeble body of
the worker was wriggling right in
the center of the great claws which,
with a twitch, could have sliced it
in two endwise. Yet the jaws did
not twitch; and in a few moments
the worker drew unconcernedly out
and moved away.</p>

<p>"The soldier was getting his
meal," whispered Denny, enthralled.
"Their mandibles are enlarged so
enormously that they can't feed
themselves. The workers, who digest
food for the whole tribe, feed
them regularly. Then if a soldier
gets in the least rebellious, he can
simply be starved to death at any
time."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Jim whispered back.
"Fancy being official stomach to
three or four other people! More
of your wonderful 'organization,' I
suppose."</p>

<p>They went on, down and down,
till Denny calculated they had at
last reached nearly to the center of
the vast city. And now they stumbled
into something weird and wonderful
indeed. Rather, they half fell
into it, for it lay down a few feet
and came as a complete surprise
in the dimness; and not till they
had recovered from their near fall
and looked around for a few seconds
did they realize where their
last few steps&mdash;the last few steps
of freedom they were to have in the
grim underground kingdom&mdash;had
taken them.</p>

<p>They were in a chamber so huge
that it made the largest of man-made
domes shrink to insignificance
by comparison.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;hundred</span> yards or more in
every direction, it extended.
And far overhead, lost in distance,
reared the arched roof. A twenty-story
building could have been
placed under that roof without trouble.</p>

<p>Lost in awe, Dennis gazed about
him; and he saw on the floor, laid in
orderly rows in countless thousands,
that which gave further cause for
wonderment: new-hatched larvae
about the size of pumpkins but a
sickly white in color&mdash;feeble, helpless
blobs of life that one day develop
into soldiers and workers,
winged rulers or police. The termite
nursery.</p>

<p>"Whew!" gasped Jim, wiping his
face. "From the heat in here you'd
think we were getting close to the
real, old-fashioned hell instead of
an artificial, insect-made one. What
are all these nauseating-looking
blobs of lard lying about here, anyway?"</p>

<p>Denny told him. "Which is the
reason for the heat," he concluded.
"Jim, it's twenty degrees warmer in
here than it is outdoors. How&mdash;<i>how</i>&mdash;can
these insects regulate the temperature
like that? The work of the
ruling brain again? But where, and
what, can that brain be?"</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll find out before we
leave this place," said Jim, more
prophetically than he knew. "Hello&mdash;we
can't get out through the door
we entered. We'll have to find another
exit. Look."</p>

<p>Dennis looked. In the doorway
they had just come through was a
soldier&mdash;a giant even among giants.
Its ten-foot jaws, like a questing, gigantic
vise, were opening and closing
regularly and rapidly across the
opening of the portal. It made no attempt
to enter the great nursery,
just stood where it was and sliced
the air rhythmically with its jaws.</p>

<p>"We haven't a chance of walking
through <i>that</i> exit!" Dennis agreed.
"Let's try the other side."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> before they could half cross
the great room&mdash;walking between
rows of life that weakly
stirred like protoplasmic mud on
either side of them&mdash;a soldier appeared
at that door, too. Like the
first, it stationed itself there, and
began the same regular, swift slicing
movements of jaws that compassed
the doorway from side to side
and halfway from top to bottom.</p>

<p>"We might possibly be able to
run through that giant's nut-cracker
before it smashed shut on us," said
Jim dubiously. "But I'd hate to try
it. There's a door at the end, too."</p>

<p>They made for this, running now.
But a third soldier appeared to
block the way out with those deadly,
clashing mandibles.</p>

<p>"You're <i>sure</i> they can't see?" demanded
Jim, clutching his spear
while he hesitated whether to try
an attack on the fearful guard or to
turn tail again. "Because they certainly
act as if they did!"</p>

<p>"Direct commands from the ruling
brain," Denny surmised soberly.
"Somewhere, perhaps half a mile
down in the earth, Something is able
to see us through solid walls, read
in our minds our intentions of what
we're to do next, and send out wordless
commands to these soldiers to
execute countermoves."</p>

<p>"Rot!" said Jim testily. "These
things are bugs, not supermen. And
the fact that they're now bigger than
we are, and much better armed,
doesn't keep them from being just
bugs. There's no real brain-power
in evidence here."</p>

<p>But an instant later he changed
his mind. They approached the
fourth and last exit from the giant
chamber. And here there was no
guard. They were able to race out
of it without interference. The
oddity of that was glaring.</p>

<p>"Denny," gasped Jim, "we're
being <i>herded</i>! Driven in a certain
direction, and for a certain reason,
by these damned things! Do you realize
that?"</p>

<p>Dennis did realize it. And a moment
later, when he glanced behind,
he realized it more.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Behind</span> them, marching in orderly
twos that filled the tunnel
from side to side, moved a body
of the soldiers. As the men moved,
they moved; never coming nearer
and never dropping behind.</p>

<p>Experimentally, Dennis stopped.
The grim soldiers stopped, too.
Dennis walked back toward them
a step or two, spear held ready.</p>

<p>The monsters did not try to attack.
On the other hand they did
not give ground, either; and as
Denny got to within a few yards of
them, one in the front line suddenly
opened and shut his ponderous
jaws.</p>

<p>They clashed together a matter
of inches from Denny's torso&mdash;a
clear warning to get on back in
the direction he had come.</p>

<p>Jim came and stood beside him,
heavy shoulder muscles bunched
into knots, standing on the balls of
his feet as a boxer stands before
flashing in at an opponent.</p>

<p>"Shall we have it out with them
here and now?" said Jim, his jaws
set. "We wouldn't have a chance&mdash;but
I'm beginning to get awfully
doubtful about the fate these things
have in store for us. I can't even
guess at what it may be&mdash;but I've
an idea it may be a lot worse than
a quick, easy death!"</p>

<p>Denny shook his head. "Let's see
it through," he muttered, looking
at the nightmare jaws of their
guard. Two sweeps of those jaws
and he and Jim would lie in halves.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> started back down the
corridor, the monstrous shepherds
moving as they did. The way
descended so steeply now that it
was difficult for them to keep their
footing. Then, yards below the level
of the horrible nursery, the tunnel
narrowed&mdash;and widened again into
a chamber which had no other opening
save the one they were being
herded into. A blind end to the
passageway.</p>

<p>"The bug Bastille," said Jim with
a mirthless grin. "Here, I guess,
we're going to wait for the powers-that-be
to judge us and give us our
sentence."</p>

<p>The giant soldiers halted. Two
of them stood in the narrowed part
of the tunnel, one behind the other,
blocking it with a double, living
barrier. Their jaws commenced
moving regularly, savagely back
and forth, open and closed. Blind
these guards might be; but no
living thing, even though it bristled
with eyes, could creep out unscathed
through the animated
threshing machine those jaws made
of that doorway. The two men were
more securely held in their prison
cell than they would have been by
two-inch doors of nickel-steel. They
could only wait there, helpless prisoners,
to learn the intentions of
the unknown Something that ruled
the great city, and that held them
so easily in its grasp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<i>In the Food Room</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Restlessly</span>, Jim paced back
and forth in the narrow dank
cell. At the doorway the two guards
opened and closed their jaws, regularly,
rhythmically, about sixty to
the minute. Hours, the two men
calculated, they had been there.
And still the clashing of those jaws
rang steadily, maddeningly in their
ears.</p>

<p>Clash-clash-clash. The things
seemed as tireless as machinery.
Clash-clash-clash. And into that
savage, tireless movement, Denny
read a sort of longing refrain.</p>

<p>"Try&mdash;to&mdash;es&mdash;cape! Try&mdash;to&mdash;es&mdash;cape!"</p>

<p>He shivered. At any time, did he
and Jim grow too fearful of the
dark future or too nerve-wracked
by the terrific suspense, they could
step into these gigantic, steel-hard
jaws. But to be sliced in two ...</p>

<p>Jim stopped his pacing, and
stared speculatively at the wall of
their cell. For the dozenth time he
raised his ponderous spear and
thrust the pointed end at the wall
with all his strength. And for the
dozenth time he was rewarded only
by seeing a flake no larger than his
clenched fist fall out.</p>

<p>"Might as well be cement!" he
rasped. "God, we're caught like flies
in a spiderweb!"</p>

<p>"Well, you wanted excitement,"
remarked Dennis, a bit acidly. The
strain was telling on him more than
on the less finely strung Holden;
but he was struggling to keep himself
in hand.</p>

<p>"So I did want excitement," said
Jim. "But I want at least a sporting
chance for my white-alley, too.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped; and both stared
swiftly toward the door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> ponderous, gruesome clashing
of jaws had stopped. The
two nightmare guards stood motionless,
as though at command. Then
they moved into the cell, straight
toward the two men.</p>

<p>"It's come!" said Jim through set
teeth. He swung his spear up,
ready to shoot it at the horny
breastplate of the nearest monster
with all his puny strength. "We're
going to catch it now!"</p>

<p>But Dennis gazed more intently;
and he saw that the blind but
ferocious creatures showed no real
signs of molesting them. Instead,
they were edging to one side. In
a moment, as the two men moved
warily to keep their distance, they
found suddenly that the soldiers
were behind them, and that the
doorway was free to them.</p>

<p>The glimpse of freedom, however,
was not inspiring. The meaning
of the move was too apparent:
they were again being herded.</p>

<p>Whatever reigning power it was
that had let them penetrate so
deeply into the trap, and then had
surrounded and imprisoned them&mdash;was
now going to honor them
with an audience.</p>

<p>"His Majesty commands," commented
Jim, reading the sinister
gesture as clearly as Denny had.
"I'll wager we're about to meet
your 'unknown intelligence,' Denny.
But be it 'super-termite' or be
it Queen&mdash;whatever it may be&mdash;I
want just one chance to use this
spear of mine!"</p>

<p>Reluctantly he stepped forth before
the fearful guard; reluctantly,
but in full command of his nerves
now that the wearing inactivity was
ended and something definite was
about to happen. Which proves but
once again the wisdom of the gods
in not allowing man to read the
future. For could Jim Holden have
foreseen the precise experience
awaiting them, his nerve control&mdash;and
Denny's, too&mdash;might not have
been so firm.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Again</span> their way led sharply
down, through tunnels loftier
and broader and glowing more brilliantly
with phosphorescence which
was a testimonial to their greater
age.</p>

<p>The efficiency of their herding
was perfect. At each side entrance
along the way stood one of the
ghastly soldiers, jaws clashing with
monotonous deadliness. Now and
again several of the monsters appeared
straight ahead, barring the
avenue, and leaving no choice but
to turn to right or left into off-branching
tunnels. Small chance
here of missing the path! And
always behind them marched their
two particular guards, closing off
their retreat.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose they sense
our approach?" wondered Jim, who
had noticed that the menacing jaw-clashing
began while they were still
fairly far from whatever side entrance
was being barred to them.
And again: "You're <i>sure</i> they can't
see?"</p>

<p>"There isn't an eye in the lot of
them," said Denny. "They must
sense our coming by the vibration
of our footsteps."</p>

<p>But when they tried tiptoeing, on
noiseless bare feet, the result was
the same. Surely the things could
not hear them for more than a few
feet; yet with no sound to guide
them, the blind guards commenced
automatically opening and closing
those invulnerable jaws with the
distant approach of the two men
just the same. They could only
ascribe it to the same force that
seemed able to follow them, step
by step and thought by thought,
though it was far away and out of
sight&mdash;the ruling brain of the termite
tribe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Ever</span> hotter it grew as they descended,
till at length a blast
of heat like a draft from a furnace
met them as they rounded a corner
and stepped into a corridor that no
longer led downward. They knew
that they were very near the ruler's
lair now, on the lowest level, deep
in the foundations of the vast pile.</p>

<p>Dennis wiped perspiration, caused
as much by emotion as by heat,
from his face. He alone of all students
on earth was going to penetrate
the very heart of the termite
mystery. He alone was going to
have at least a glimpse of the baffling
intelligence that science had
guessed about for so many decades
He ... alone. For it was hardly
likely that he would ever get back
up to the surface of earth to share
his knowledge.</p>

<p>How different was this adventure
from what he had hoped it might
be! He had thought that the two
of them might simply enter the
termitary, mingle&mdash;perilously, but
with at least a margin of safety&mdash;with
the blind race it housed, and
walk out again whenever they
pleased. But from the moment of
entering they'd had no chance.
They had been hopelessly in the
clutch of the insects; played with,
indulged, and finally trapped, to be
led at last like dogs on a leash to
the lair of the ruling power.</p>

<p>They rounded another corner and
now, ahead of them, they saw what
must be the end of this last and
deepest of all the tunnels. This end
showed as a glare of light. Real
light, not the soft gleam of the
rotting wood walls which was
already paling feebly in comparison.
The glare ahead of them, indeed,
had something of the texture of
electric light. Neither Jim nor Dennis
could repress a sudden start;
it was like coming abruptly onto a
man-made fact, a bit of man-made
world in the midst of this insect
hell.</p>

<p>The damp heat was almost paralyzing
now. Their limbs felt weak
as they stumbled toward the light.
But they were inexorably herded
forward, and soon were at the
threshold of the oddly illuminated
chamber.</p>

<p>Now the two stopped for an instant
and sniffed, as a peculiar odor
came to their nostrils. It was a
vague but fearsome odor, indescribable,
making their skin crawl.
A smell of decay&mdash;of death&mdash;and
yet somehow of rank and fetid life.
A combination of charnel-house and
menagerie smell.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Denny</span> blanched as an inkling
of what was before them came
to his mind. He remembered the
swooping wasp, that had so narrowly
missed them at the start of
their adventure. The wasp, he
knew, was not the only insect that
had certain dread ways of stocking
its larder and keeping the contents
of that larder fresh! The termites
did not customarily follow these
practises. Yet&mdash;yet the odor coming
from the place before them certainly
suggested ... But he tried
to thrust such apprehensions from
his thoughts.</p>

<p>They entered the chamber. The
two gigantic soldiers stopped on
the threshold behind them and took
up their standard guard attitudes.
The men stared about them....</p>

<p>It was huge, this chamber, almost
as huge as the nursery chamber
they had blundered into. The
source of the light was not apparent.
It seemed to glow from
walls and floor and ceiling, as
though it were a box of glass with
sunshine pouring in at all six
sides.</p>

<p>And now horror began to mingle
with awed interest, as they took in
more comprehensively the sights in
that place, and saw precisely what
it contained.</p>

<p>Denny's apprehensions had been
only too well founded. For larder,
food storeroom, the chamber certainly
was. But what a storeroom!
And in what state the "food" that
stocked it was!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">All</span> along the vast floor were
laid rows of inert, fantastic
bodies. Insects. The whole small-insect
world seemed to be represented
here. One or more of everything
that crawled, flew, walked or
bored, seemed gathered in this great
room. Grubs, flies, worms, ants,
things soft and slimy and things
grim and armored, were piled side
by side like cordwood.</p>

<p>These hulks, nearly all larger
than the two quarter-inch men, lay
stark and motionless where they
had been dropped. From them came
the odor that had stopped Jim and
Denny on the threshold&mdash;the
strange odor of blended life and
death. And the reason for the queer
odor became apparent as the two
gazed more closely at the motionless
hulks.</p>

<p>These things, like figures out of
a delirium in their great size and
exaggerated frightfulness, were
rigid as in death&mdash;but they were
nevertheless not dead! Helpless as
so many lumps of stone, they were
still horribly, pitifully alive. Paralyzed,
in some inscrutable termite
fashion, probably fully conscious of
their surroundings, they could only
lie there and wait for their turn
to come to be devoured by the ferocious
creatures that had dragged
them down to this, the bowels of
the mound city.</p>

<p>Besides these things bound in the
rigidity of death, there was more
normal life. There were termites in
that vast storeroom, too; but they
were specialized creatures, such as
termitary life abounds in, that were
so distorted as to be hardly recognizable
as termites.</p>

<p>Along one wall of the place,
hanging head down and fastened
there for life, was a row of worker
termites whose function was obviously
that of reservoirs: their
abdomens, so enormously distended
as to be nearly transparent, glistened
in varying colors to indicate
that they contained various liquids
whose purpose could only be
guessed at.</p>

<p>Living cisterns, never to move,
never to know life even in the
monotonous, joyless way of the normal
worker, they hung there to be
dipped into whenever the master
that reigned over this inferno, or
his immediate underlings, desired
some of their contents!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> addition, there were several
each of two forms of termite
soldier such as they had not seen
before, standing rigidly at attention
about the place.</p>

<p>At the door, of course, were the
two creatures with the enormous
mandibles that had escorted the
pigmy men to the larder. But these
others were as different as though
they belonged to a different race.</p>

<p>Three had heads that were hideously
bulbous in form, and which
were flabby and elastic instead of
armored with thick horn as were
the heads of the usual soldiers.
Like living syringes, these heads
were; perambulating bulbs filled
with some defensive or offensive
liquid to be squirted out at the
owner's will.</p>

<p>The third kind of soldier was
represented in the spectacle of termites
with heads that were huge
and conical, resembling bungs, or
the tapered cylindrical corks with
which one plugs a bottle. These,
Denny knew from his studies, had
been evolved by termite biology
for the purpose of temporarily
stopping up any breach in termitary
mound-wall or tunnel while
the workers could assemble and repair
the chink with more solid and
permanent building material.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> how fantastically, gruesomely
different these colossal
figures looked, here in the deepest
stronghold of termitedom, than as
scurrying little insects viewed
under an entomologist's glass! And
how appallingly different was the
viewpoint from which they were
now being observed&mdash;here where
the human observers were equal in
size, and doomed at any moment
perhaps to be paralyzed and piled
with the helpless live things that
made up the rest of the "larder"!</p>

<p>And the presiding genius of this
mysterious, underground storeroom&mdash;where
was it? Denny and Jim
looked about over the rows of live
food, and among the termite soldiers
with their odd heads, in vain
for a creature that might conceivably
be the super-insect that so
omnipotently ruled the mound.</p>

<p>Off in a corner they saw two
more termites&mdash;standard worker
types, standing motionless side by
side, with a queer sort of mushroom
growth linking them together&mdash;a
large, gray-white ball borne
mutually on their backs. But that
was all. The listing of those two
workers concluded the roll-call of
termites in the chamber as far as
the two men could see. And the
two were&mdash;just ordinary workers.</p>

<p>"I guess His Majesty is out,"
said Jim. But his voice, in spite of
the attempted levity of the words,
was low-pitched and somber. "Most
impolite to keep us waiting&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as Denny sharply
threw up his hand. And he too
gazed at the maneuver that had
caught Denny's wary attention.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This</span> was nothing save that the
various soldiers in the chamber&mdash;seven
of them, besides the two that
never left their stations at the door&mdash;had
moved. But they had moved
in concert, almost as harmoniously
in unison as if performing some
sort of drill.</p>

<p>In a single line they filed across
the rows of inert, palpitating, paralyzed
bodies; and in a line they surrounded
Jim and Denny in a hollow
square about twenty feet across.
There they took up their stations,
the three soldiers with the syringe-heads,
and the four with the unwieldy
craniums that resembled
bungs.</p>

<p>So perfectly had the move been
executed, so perfectly and in unison
had it been timed, that there
could be little doubt it had resulted
from a direct order. But where was
the thing to give the command?
Where was the head-general? In
some far place, on his way to inspect
the new and odd kind of
prisoners, and giving orders to hold
them yet more closely in anticipation
of that inspection?</p>

<p>Jim turned to Denny and started
to voice some of his thoughts. But
the words were killed by the light
that had appeared suddenly in
Denny's eyes. In them had appeared
a gleam of almost superstitious terror.</p>

<p>"Jim!" gasped Denny, raising his
hand and pointing with trembling
forefinger. "Jim&mdash;<i>look</i>!"</p>

<p>Jim turned to gaze, and his spear,
clutched with almost convulsive
desperation till this moment, sagged
to the floor from his limp hinds.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> thing Denny had pointed
at was the curious, large mushroom
growth supported jointly on
the backs of the two worker termites.
It had been across the
chamber from them when they first
saw it. Now it was moving toward
them, steadily, borne by the team
of workers. And now, clearly, for
the first time, they saw what it
really was.</p>

<p>It was a head, that mushroom
growth. Rather, the whitish-gray,
soft-looking thing was a brain. For
it had long ago burst free of the
original insect skull casing in
which it had been born. Evidence
that it had once been a normal, termite
head was given by the fact
that here and there, on sides and
top of the huge, spongy-looking
mass, were brownish scales&mdash;fragments
of the casing that had once
contained its bulk.</p>

<p>Set low down under the sphere,
with the whitish-gray mass beetling
up over them like a curving cliff,
were eyes; great, staring, dull
things of the type termites have
during the short-winged periods of
their existences. Like huge round
stones, those eyes regarded the two
men as the team of termites
marched closer.</p>

<p>Hanging down from the great
mass was an abortive miniature of
a body&mdash;soft, shriveled abdomen,
almost nonexistent chest, and tiny,
sticklike legs that trailed helplessly
along the floor as the termites&mdash;in
the manner of two men who support
a helpless third man between them&mdash;bore
it forward.</p>

<p>Here, then was the Intellect that
ruled the tribe, the super-termite,
the master mind of the mound!
This travesty of a termite! This
thing with wasted limbs and torso,
and with enormous, voracious brain
that drained all sustenance constantly
from the body! It was, in
the insect world, a parallel to the
dream that present-day Man sometimes
has of Man a million years
in the future: a thing all head and
staring eyes, with a brain so enlarged
that it must be artificially
supported on its flabby torso.</p>

<p>"I guess His Majesty is out," Jim
had said, with a shaky attempt at
lightness.</p>

<p>But he now realized his mistake.
His Majesty hadn't been out. His
Majesty had been with them all
along&mdash;a four-foot, irregular sphere
of grayish-white nerve matter and
intricately wrinkled cortex dependent
for movement on borrowed
backs and legs&mdash;and was now peering
at them out of the only pair
of eyes in the termitary as though
in doubt as to what to do first with
his helpless-seeming captives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<i>"Clinging Brown Stuff"</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Bemused</span>, appalled, the two
gazed at this almost disembodied
brain that held them captive.
It continued to come steadily
toward them, carried by its two
faithful slaves; and the grotesque
termite soldiers, that had closed
about them in a hollow square,
parted to let it through.</p>

<p>Such was the bewitchment of the
two men as they stared at the monstrosity,
that they did not hear the
slight clashing of horn that accompanied
a swift movement of one
of the soldiers behind them.</p>

<p>The first thing they knew of
such a movement was when they
felt their arms pinioned to their
sides with crushing force, and
looked down to find a pair of hard,
jointed forelegs coiled about their
bodies. In answer to some voiceless
command, one of the termites with
the conical heads had approached
behind them and wound a leg
around each.</p>

<p>Sweat stood out on Denny's forehead
at the repellent touch of that
living bond. He turned and twisted
wildly.</p>

<p>Jim was struggling madly in the
grip of the other foreleg. Great
shoulders bulging with the effort,
muscles standing in knots on his
heavy arms, he nearly succeeded in
breaking free. Denny felt the tie
that bound him relax ever so little
as the monster centered its attention
on the stronger man.</p>

<p>With a last effort, he tore his
right arm free, and wriggled partly
around in the thing's grip. He
raised the spear and plunged it
slantingly down into the hideous
body.</p>

<p>This type of termite was armored
more poorly than the others. Only
its head was plated with horn;
chest and abdomen were soft and
vulnerable as those of any humble
worker in the mound. The spear
tore into it for two-thirds its
length. There was a squeak&mdash;the
first sound they had heard&mdash;from
the wounded monster. The clutching
forelegs tightened terribly, then
began to loosen, quivering spasmodically
as they slowly relinquished
their grasp.</p>

<p>Denny bounded free and again
sent the length of his spear into the
loathsome body. Jim, meanwhile,
had leaped toward his fallen spear.
He stooped to pick it up&mdash;and was
lost!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Obeying</span> another wordless order,
one of the ghastly,
syringe-headed monsters had
stepped out of line with the start
of the short struggle. This one
bounded on Jim just as he leaned
over for his weapon.</p>

<p>Denny shouted a warning, started
to run to his friend's aid. The dying
termite, with a last burst of incredible
vitality, caught his leg and
held him.</p>

<p>In an instant it was done. The
termite with the distorted head had
drenched Jim with a brown, thick
liquid that covered him from shoulder
to feet&mdash;and Jim was writhing
helplessly on the floor.</p>

<p>Denny burst loose at last from
the feebly clutching foreleg. He
straightened, poised his spear, and
with a strength born of near madness
shot it at the syringe-headed
thing's chest.</p>

<p>But this one was different, armored
to the full save for its soft
cranium. The steel bar glanced
harmlessly from the heavy horn
breastplate. In answer, the monster
wheeled and drenched Dennis,
too, with the loathsome liquid.</p>

<p>On the instant Dennis was helpless.
As Jim had done, he sank to
the floor, his body constricted in a
sheath that tightened as it dried
and which bound him as securely
as any straitjacket might have done.</p>

<p>The two rolled on the floor, trying
to shed the terrible coating of
hardening fluid that contracted
about them. But they were as impotent
as two flies that had rolled
in the sticky slime of some super-flypaper.
At last they gave it up.</p>

<p>Panting, helpless as mummies,
they glared up at the stony eyes of
the ruler-termite. The team of
workers moved, bearing their burden
of almost bodiless, mushroom
brain like well-oiled machines.</p>

<p>Their forelegs went out. The
two men were shoved along the
floor ahead of the monarch&mdash;and
were laid in one of the lines of
paralyzed insects so patently held
as the ruler's private food supply!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> great, stony eyes were next
bent, as though in curiosity, on
the spears that had done such damage
to the termite with the conical
head. In the true insect world there
was no such phenomenon as those
glittering steel bars; and it appeared
that the over-developed
brain of the monarch held questions
concerning their nature.</p>

<p>The team of termites wheeled,
and walked over to the nearest
spear, trailing the feeble, atrophied
legs of their rider as they went.
They squatted close to the floor,
and the staring eyes examined the
spears at close range. Then the
owner of the eyes apparently sent
out another command; for one of
the guards at the door left its post
and drew near, scissor-mandibles
opened in obedience.</p>

<p>The hard mandible's clashed over
one of the steel bars. The jaws
crunched shut, with a nerve-rasping
grind. They made, naturally, no impression
on the bar. The guard retired
to its post at the doorway.</p>

<p>The termite-ruler seemed to think
this over, for a moment. Then at
some telepathic order, its two bearers
picked up the spear and carried
it, and their physically helpless
ruler, over to one of the living
cisterns&mdash;one filled with a dark red
liquid.</p>

<p>One of the beasts of burden
reached up and thrust an end of
the spear into the hugely distended
abdomen filled with the unknown
red liquid. The spear was withdrawn,
with about a foot of its
blunt end reddened by the fluid.
The termite laid it down; the staring,
dull eyes watched it....</p>

<p>Slowly the end of the bar dulled
with swift oxidation; slowly it
turned brownish and flaked away,
almost entirely consumed. The acid&mdash;if
that was what the red stuff
was&mdash;was awesomely powerful, at
least with inorganic substances.</p>

<p>The termite team turned away
from the bar, as if it were now a
matter of indifference to the bloated
brain borne on their backs. It approached
the men again.</p>

<p>"I suppose," groaned Jim, "that
our turn is next. The thing will
probably have us dipped into the
red stuff, to see if we're consumed,
too."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> here His Majesty's curiosity
was interrupted while
he partook of nourishment.</p>

<p>The clashing jaws of the two termite
soldiers at the door stopped
for a moment. Jim and Dennis
struggled to turn their heads&mdash;all
of them they could move&mdash;to see
what the cessation of jaw-clashing
might mean.</p>

<p>Three worker termites squeezed
past. They approached one of the
line of paralyzed insect hulks, and
sank their mandibles into a garden
slug. They tugged at this until
they had it under the live cistern
of red liquid into which the spear
had been thrust.</p>

<p>One of the three flicked drops of
the reddish stuff onto the inert
slug, till it was well sprinkled.
Then they dragged the carcass back
to the termite-ruler.</p>

<p>They got it there barely in time.
In a matter of seconds after they
had dropped it before the monarch,
the slug had collapsed into a half-liquid
puddle of decomposed protoplasm
on the floor. One of the main
functions&mdash;if not <i>the</i> main function&mdash;of
the red acid, it seemed, was to
act as a powerful digestive juice
for His Majesty's food, predigesting
it before it was taken into the
feeble body for nourishment.</p>

<p>The termite team settled down
over the semi-liquid mess that had
been the slug, and tilted back. Now,
under the huge globe of the brain,
Jim and Denny saw exposed a
small, soft mouth fringed by the
tiny rudiments of atrophied mandibles.
The repulsive little mouth
touched the acid-softened mass....</p>

<p>The withered abdomen filled out.
The whitish-gray lump of brain-matter
grew slightly darker. It
looked as though the mass of the
dead slug were as large as the total
bulk of the termite ruler; but not
until the meal was nearly gone did
the voracious feeding stop.</p>

<p>The three workers that had
spread the banquet before their
monarch, left the chamber. The
guards resumed their interrupted
jaw-clashing, which seemed senseless
now: the captives, though not
paralyzed as were the other captives
there, were held so helpless
by the dried and hardened fluid
that escape was out of the question.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> misshapen burden of the
termite team seemed to relax
a little, lethargically, as though so
gorged with food as to render
almost inactive the grotesquely exaggerated
brain. The stony eyes became
duller. Plainly the captives
were to have a brief respite
while the huge meal was assimilated.</p>

<p>"If I could get loose for just one
minute," Jim took the opportunity
to whisper to Denny, "and get at
my spear&mdash;I think there would be
one termite-ruler less in the world!"</p>

<p>Denny nodded. He had been
thinking along the same lines as
Jim: that bloated, swollen brain
seemed a very vulnerable thing.
Soft and boneless and formless, contained
only by the dirty-white,
membranous skin, it did appear a
tempting target for a spear thrust.
And now, sluggish with its meal, it
seemed less alert and on guard.</p>

<p>Jim went on with his thought.</p>

<p>"I think you scientists are wrong
about <i>all</i> the termites having intelligence,"
he whispered. "I believe
that thing has the only reasoning
mind in the mound. Look at those
two guards at the door, for instance.
There's no earthly need for
them to keep guard as eternally as
they do. We can't even move, let
alone try to escape. They're utterly
brainless, commanded to guard the
entrance with their mandibles, and
continuing to guard it accordingly
although the need for it is past."</p>

<p>Jim worked almost unthinkingly
at his bonds. "If we could kill the
wizened, little, big-headed thing,
we might have a chance. There'd
be nothing left to guide the tribe,
no ruling power to direct them
against us. We might even ...
escape!"</p>

<p>"Through the entire city&mdash;with
untold thousands of these horrible
things on our trail?" objected
Denny gloomily.</p>

<p>"But if the untold thousands
were dummies, used to being directed
in every move by this master
brain," urged Jim, "they might just
blunder around while we slipped
through the lines...."</p>

<p>His words trailed into silence.
Escape seemed so improbable as to
be hardly worth talking about.
Quiet reigned for a long time.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was broken finally by Dennis.</p>

<p>"Jim," he breathed suddenly,
"can you see my legs?"</p>

<p>With difficulty Jim turned his
head. "Yes," he said. "Why?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me I can move my
left knee&mdash;just a little!"</p>

<p>Jim looked more closely. "By
heaven!" he exclaimed. "Denny, <i>I
think the brown stuff is cracking</i>!
Maybe it was never intended to be
more than a temporary bond, to
hold an enemy helpless just long
enough for it to be killed! Maybe
it hardens as it dries so that it loses
all resiliency! Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped. A faint quivering of
the ruler's withered little legs
heralded its reawakening consciousness.</p>

<p>"Act helpless!" whispered Denny
excitedly, as he too saw that faint
stir of awakening. "Don't let the
thing get an idea of what we're
thinking. Because ... we <i>might</i> get
our moment of freedom...."</p>

<p>Both lay relaxed on the floor,
eyes half closed. And in the hardening
substance that covered them
all over like a shell of cloudy
brown bakelite, appeared more minute
seams as it dried unevenly on
the flexible human flesh beneath it.
Whether Jim's guess that it was
only a temporary bond was correct,
or whether it had been developed
to harden relentlessly only over unyielding
surfaces of horn such as
the termites' deadliest enemy, the
ants, wear for armor, will never be
known. But in a matter of moments
it became apparent that it was
going to prove too brittle to continue
clamping flesh as elastic as
that of the two humans!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">By</span> now the termite-ruler seemed
to have recovered fully from
its gargantuan meal. And while, of
course, there was no expression of
any kind to be read in the stony,
dull eyes, its actions seemed once
more to indicate curiosity about
these queer, two-legged bugs that
wandered in here where they had
no business to be.</p>

<p>The team of workers bore it
close again, lowered the great head
close to Denny. One of the team
began chipping at the brown shell
where it encased and held immovably
to his body Denny's left hand.</p>

<p>A bit of the shell dropped away,
exposing the fingers. Delicately, accurately,
the worker's normal-sized
but powerful mandibles edged the
little finger away from the rest&mdash;and
closed down over it....</p>

<p>"Denny!" burst out Jim, who
could just see, out of the corners
of his eyes, what was being done.
"My God ... Denny...."</p>

<p>Dennis himself said nothing. His
face went white as chalk, and great
drops of perspiration stood out on
his forehead. But no sound came
from his tortured lips.</p>

<p>The finger was lifted to the terrible
little mouth under the gigantic
head. The mouth received it;
the worker nuzzled with its mandibles
for another finger. The monarch,
having tried the taste of this
latest addition to his larder, had
found it good.</p>

<p>Jim writhed and twisted in his
weakening bonds. There was a soft
snapping as several now thoroughly
dried sections of the brown substance
cracked loose. The termite
team whirled around; the ruler
stared, as though in sudden realization
of danger.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">More</span> furiously Jim fought his
bonds. Dennis was still, recovering
slowly from the nauseating
weakness that had followed the
pain of his mutilated hand. There
was less blood flow than might
have been expected, due, perhaps,
to the fact that the nipping mandibles
had pinched some of the encasing
shell tight over the wound.</p>

<p>With a dull crack, a square foot
of the brown stuff burst from Jim's
straining chest. But now the monarch
moved to correct the situation.</p>

<p>The two giant soldiers at the
doorway started across the great
room toward them. Simultaneously,
a second of the syringe-headed termites
moved to renew the bonds
that were being broken.</p>

<p>But the move had come a shade
too late. Jim kicked his legs free
with a last wild jerk, and staggered
to his feet. His arms were still held,
in a measure, in spite of his utmost
efforts to free them of the clinging
brown stuff. But he could, and
did, run away from the body of
soldiers surrounding the monarch
just before the deadly syringe of
the first attacking termite could
function against him.</p>

<p>The great, flabby head hurtled
his way. But he knew what to expect,
now. As the slimy brown
stream, directed by the agitated termite-ruler,
squirted toward him, he
leaped alertly aside&mdash;leaped again
as the head swung around&mdash;and saw
with savage hope that the monster
had exhausted its discharge!</p>

<p>The two soldiers from the doorway
closed in on him now. With
their apparent command of the situation,
the monstrosities with the
bung- and syringe-heads closed in
more tightly around their monarch.
Theirs, evidently to protect that
vulnerable big brain, and leave the
attacking to others.</p>

<p>Jim fled down between the rows
of paralyzed insects. The two great
guards from the doorway, mandibles
reaching fiercely toward the
fugitive, followed. And there commenced,
there in that deep-buried
insect hell, a chase for life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<i>The Coming of the Soldiers</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> a moment Jim was handicapped
in fleetness and agility
by the fact that his arms were
hampered. But the two hideous
guards, though each was a dozen
times more powerful than any man
its size, were handicapped in a
chase, too&mdash;by the very weight of
their enormous mandibles. In their
thundering chase after Jim, they
resembled nothing so much as two
powerful but clumsy battleships
chasing a relatively puny but much
more agile destroyer.</p>

<p>Behind the great bulk of a paralyzed
June bug, Jim halted for a
fraction while he tore his arms at
last free of the clinging brown
stuff. The guards rushed around the
June bug at him.</p>

<p>He leaped for the row of hanging
cisterns; and there, while he
dodged from one to another of the
loathsome vats, he thought over a
plan that had come to his racing
mind. It wasn't much of a plan, and
it seemed utterly futile in the face
of the odds against him. But he
had boasted, before starting this
mad adventure, that Man's wits
were superior to any bug's. It was
time now to see if his boast had
been an empty one.</p>

<p>He feinted toward the far end of
the laboratory. The guards, acting
always as if they had a dozen eyes
instead of none, rushed to prevent
this, cutting across his path and
closing the exit with clashing jaws.</p>

<p>Jim raced toward the spot where
Denny lay. This was within twenty
yards of the spot where, behind
his ring of guards, the big-brained
ruler now cowered. But, while one
of the syringe-monsters sent a
brown stream blindly toward the
leaping, shifting man, no other attacking
move was made. The soldiers
remained chained to their
posts. Jim retrieved his spear&mdash;and
the first part of his almost hopeless
plan had succeeded!</p>

<p>It was good, the feel of that
smooth steel. He balanced the ponderous
weapon lightly. An ineffective
thing against the plates of
living armor covering the scissor-mandibles.
But it was not against
them&mdash;at least not directly&mdash;that he
was planning to use it now!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Once</span> more he darted toward the
living cisterns. The soldiers
followed close behind.</p>

<p>Under the bulging abdomen of
the termite containing the reddish
acid, Jim halted as though to make
a defiant last stand against the
guards. They stopped, too, then began
to advance on him from either
side, more slowly, like two great
cats stalking a mouse.</p>

<p>Muscles bunched for a lightning-quick
move, eyes narrowed to mere
slits as he calculated distances and
fractions of a second. Jim stood
there beneath the great acid vat.
The mandibles were almost within
slicing distance now.</p>

<p>The guards opened wide their
tremendous jaws, forming two
halves of a deadly horn circle that
moved swiftly to encompass him.
They leaped....</p>

<p>With barely a foot left him, Jim
darted back, then poised his spear
and shot it straight toward the
bulging, live sack that held the
acid above the guards.</p>

<p>The acid spurted from the spear
hole. Jim clenched his fists and unconsciously
held his breath till his
chest ached, as the scarlet liquid
spread over the great hulks that
twisted and fought in ponderous
frenzy to untangle legs and antennae
and mandibles from the snarl
their collision had made of them.</p>

<p>The acid bit through steel and
human flesh. On the other hand, it
had not harmed the horny flipper
of the termite worker that had
flicked it onto the garden slug. Did
that mean that the flipper was immunized
to the stuff, like the lining
of the stomach, which is unharmed
by acids powerful enough to decompose
other organic master? Or did
it mean that <i>all</i> horn was untouched
by it?</p>

<p>He groaned aloud. The two great
insects had drawn apart by now,
and had sprung from under the
shattered acid vat. Again they were
on the trail. The maneuver had
been fruitless! The chase was on
again, which meant&mdash;since he could
not hope to elude the blind but ably
directed creatures forever&mdash;that all
hope was lost....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Then</span> he shouted with triumph.
A massive foreleg dropped
from one of the guards, to crash to
the floor. Whether or not the acid
was able to set on the horny exterior
of the termites, it was as
deadly to their soft interiors as
to any other sort of flesh! The
acid had found the joint of that
foreleg and had eaten through it
as hot iron sinks through butter!</p>

<p>Still the injured creature came
on, with Jim ever retreating, twisting
and dodging from one side of
the huge room to the other, leaping
over the smaller paralyzed insects
and darting behind the larger carcasses.
But now the thing's movements
were very slow&mdash;as were the
movements of its companion.</p>

<p>Another leg fell hollowly to the
floor, like an abandoned piece of
armor; and then two at once from
the second termite.</p>

<p>Both stopped, shuddering convulsively.
The agony of those two
enormous, dumb and blind things
must have been inconceivable. The
acid was by now spending its awful
force in their vitals, having seeped
down through every joint and crevice
in their living armor. They were
hardly more than huge shells of
horn, kept alive only by their unbelievable
vitality.</p>

<p>One more feeble lunge both made
in concert, toward the puny adversary
that had outwitted them.
Then both, as though at a spoken
command, stopped dead still. Next
instant they crashed to the floor,
shaking it in their fall.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">For</span> a second Jim could only
stand there and gaze at their
monstrous bodies. His plan had succeeded
beyond all belief; and realization
of this success left him
dazed for an instant. But it was
only for an instant.</p>

<p>Recovering himself, he raced to
the acid vat to recover the spear
he'd punctured it with&mdash;only three
feet of it was left: the rest had
been eaten away by the powerful
stuff&mdash;and then wheeled to help
Denny.</p>

<p>By now the crackling brown stuff
had fallen from Denny, too&mdash;enough,
at least for him to struggle
to his feet and hasten its cracking
by tearing at it with partially
loosened hands. As Jim reached
him, he freed himself entirely save
for the last few bits that stuck to
him as bits of shell cling to a newborn
chick.</p>

<p>They turned together toward the
corner where the termite-ruler was
cowering behind the guards that
surrounded it. Intellect to a degree
phenomenal for an insect, this
thing might have; but of the blind
fierce courage possessed by its subjects,
it assuredly had none! In
proof of this was the fact that
when the half dozen specialized soldiers
ringing it round might have
leaped to the aid of the two clumsy
door guards and probably have
ended the uneven fight in a few
minutes, the craven monarch had
ordered them to stay at their
guard-posts rather than take the
risk of remaining unguarded and
defenseless for a single moment!
Increasing intelligence apparently
had resulted (as only too often it
does in the world of men) in decreasing
bravery!</p>

<p>An attack on the thing, closely
guarded as it was, seemed hopeless.
Those enormous, flat-topped heads
held ready to present their steely
surfaces as shields! Those armored
terrors with the syringe-heads&mdash;one
of which still held a full cargo of
the terrible brown fluid that at a
touch could bind the limbs of the
men once more in the straitjacket
embrace! What could the two do
against that barrier?</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Nevertheless</span>, without a
word being spoken, and without
a second's hesitation, Jim and
Denny advanced on the bristling
ring&mdash;and the heart of termite
power it enclosed. Not only was
the slimmest of hopes of escape
rendered impossible while the super-termite
lived to direct its subjects
against them&mdash;but also they
had a reckoning to collect from the
thing if they could....</p>

<p>Denny glanced down at his hand,
from which slow red drops still
oozed.</p>

<p>At their approach, the guarding
ring shifted so that the soldier
whose head was still bulging with
the brown liquid, faced them. The
two men stopped, warily. They
must draw the sting from that monster
before they dared try to come
closer.</p>

<p>Jim feinted, leaping in and to
one side. The guard turned with
him, moved forward a bit as though
to discharge a brown stream at
him&mdash;but held its fire. Jim moved
still closer, then leaped crabwise to
one side as the brain behind the
guards telepathed in a panic for its
blind minion to release some of its
ammunition. The flood missed Jim
only by inches.</p>

<p>Denny took his turn at gambling
with death. He shouted ringingly,
and ran a dozen steps straight at
the monster that was the principal
menace. At the last moment he
flung himself aside as Jim had
done&mdash;but this time the stream was
not to be drawn.</p>

<p>Still most of the deadly liquid
was left; the thing's head bulged
with it. And no real move could
be made till that head was somehow
emptied.</p>

<p>"Your spear!" panted Denny, who
was armed only with the three-foot
club which was all that was left
of the spear that had entered the
acid bag.</p>

<p>Jim nodded. As he had done
under the acid vat, he drew it back
for a throw&mdash;and shot it forward
with all the power of his magnificent
shoulders.</p>

<p>The glittering length of steel
slashed into the flabby, living
syringe. A fountain of molasseslike
liquid gushed out.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> move had not been elaborately
reasoned out; it had
been a natural; almost instinctive
one, simply a blow struck for the
purpose of draining the dread reservoir
of its sticky contents. But the
results&mdash;as logical and inevitable as
they were astounding and unforeseen&mdash;were
such that the move
could not have been wiser had all
the gods of war conspired to help
the two men with shrewd advice.</p>

<p>The searching spear-point had
evidently found the brain behind
the syringe of the thing; for it
reared in an agony that could only
have been that of approaching
death, and ran amuck.</p>

<p>No longer did the ruling brain
that crouched behind it have the
power to guide its movements, it
seemed. The telepathic communications
had been snapped with that
crashing spear-point. It charged
blindly, undirected, in havoc-wreaking
circles. And in an instant the
whole aspect of the battle had been
changed.</p>

<p>The ring of living armor presented
by the other soldiers was
broken as the enormous, dying termite
charged among them. Furthermore,
the fountain of thick brown
liquid exuding from its head,
smeared the limbs of the soldiers
the blind, crazed thing touched, as
well as its own.</p>

<p>In thirty seconds or less the
wounded giant was down, still alive,
but wriggling feebly in a binding
sheath of its own poison. And with
it, so smeared as to be utterly out
of the struggle, were three of the
others.</p>

<p>Quick to seize the advantage, Jim
leaped to wrench his spear from
the conquered giant's head. And
side by side he and Denny started
again the charge against the ruler's
guards, which, while still mighty in
defense, were by their very nature
unable to attack.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Three</span> of these guards were
left. Two of them were the
freaks with the great, armored,
bung-heads&mdash;and the soft and vulnerable
bodies. The third was of the
syringe type, with invulnerable
horn breastplate and body armor&mdash;but
with a head that, now its fatal
liquid was exhausted, was useless
in battle.</p>

<p>"Take 'em one by one," grunted
Jim, setting the example by
swinging his spear at the body of
the nearest guard. "We'll get at
that damn thing with the overgrown
brains yet!"</p>

<p>His spear clanged on iron-hard
horn as the termite swung its unwieldy
head to protect its unarmored
body. The force of the contact
tore the spear from his hand;
but almost before it could drop, he
had recovered it. And in that flashing
instant Denny had darted in
at the side of the thing and half
disembowelled it with a thrust of
the acid-blunted point of his three-foot
bar, and a lightninglike wrench
up and to the side.</p>

<p>"Only two left!" cried Jim,
stabbing at the flabby head of the
syringe-monster that loomed a foot
above his own head. "We'll do it
yet, Denny!"</p>

<p>But at that moment a clashing
and rattling at the doorway suddenly
burst in on the din of the
eery fight. Both men stared at
each other with surrender in their
eyes.</p>

<p>"Now we <i>are</i> all through!" yelled
Jim, almost calm in his complete
resignation. "But we'll try to reach
that devilish thing before we're
doomed!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> the heat of the swift, deadly
fray, the two men had forgotten
for the moment, that these few soldiers
ranged against them were not
all the fighters in the mound city.
But the quaking intellect they were
striving to reach had not forgotten!
At some time early in the one-sided
struggle it had sent out a
soundless call to arms. And now, in
the doorway, struggling to force
through in numbers too great for
the entrance's narrow limits, were
the first of the soldier hordes the
ruler had commanded to report here
for fight duty. And behind them, as
far as the eye could see, the tunnel
was blocked by yet others marching
to kill the creatures that menaced
their leader. The abortive effort at
escape, it seemed, was doomed.</p>

<p>The strength of desperation augmented
Jim's naturally massive
muscular power. He whirled his
spear high over his head, clubwise.
Disdaining now to try for a thrust
behind and to one side of the great
conical head that faced him, he
brought the bar down with sledge-hammer
force on the horn-plated
thing.</p>

<p>As though it had been a willow
wand, the big bar whistled through
the air in its descent. With a crack
that could be heard even above the
crashing mandibles of the soldiers
pouring across the hundred-yard
floor toward the scene of battle, the
bar landed on the living buckler of
a head.</p>

<p>The head could not have been
actually harmed. But the brain behind
it was patently jarred and
numbed for an instant. The great
creature stood still, its head weaving
slowly back and forth. Jim
swung his improvised club in another
terrific arc....</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Denny</span> darted around behind
the ponderously wheeling
bulk of the last remaining guard to
the team of worker termites. He,
too, swung his arms high&mdash;over the
bloated brain-bag that cowered
down between the backs that bore
it&mdash;leaping here and there to avoid
the blunt mandibles of the burden
bearers. He, too, brought down his
three-foot length of bar with all the
force he could muster, the sight of
that swollen, hideous head atop the
withered remnants of termite body
lending power to his muscles.</p>

<p>And now, just as the nearest of
the soldiers reached out for them,
the termite-ruler lay helpless on the
backs of its living crutches, with its
attenuated body quivering convulsively,
and its balloonlike, fragile
head cleft almost in two halves. It
was possible that even that terrific
injury might not be fatal to a thing
so great and flexible of brain, and
so divorced from the ills as well as
the powers of the flesh. But for the
moment at least it was helpless,
an inert mass on the patient backs
of the termite team.</p>

<p>"To the acid vat," snapped Jim.
"We'll make our last stand there."</p>

<p>Dodging the nearest snapping
mandibles, Denny ran beside his
companion to where the termite,
dead now, with its distended abdomen
deflated and the last of the
acid trickling from the hole caused
by Jim's spear, still hung head
down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>The powerful ruler of this vast
underground city was crushed&mdash;for
the moment at least. But the
fate of the two humans seemed no
less certain than it had before.
For now the huge chamber was
swarming with the giant soldiers.
In numbers so great that they
crashed and rattled against each
other as they advanced, they
marched toward the place where
the broken monarch still quivered
in weak convulsions&mdash;and behind
which, near the acid vat, the two
men crouched.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<i>The Cannibalistic Orgy</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">At</span> first Jim and Dennis could
only comprehend the <i>numbers</i>
of the foe&mdash;could only grip their
bars and resolve to die as expensively
as possible. But then, as a
few seconds elapsed during which
they were amazingly not charged by
the insects, they began to notice the
<i>actions</i> of the things.</p>

<p>They were swarming so thickly
about the spot where their leader
had fallen that all the men could
see was their struggling bodies.
And the movements of these soldiers
were puzzling in the extreme.</p>

<p>The things seemed, of a sudden,
to be fighting among themselves!
At any rate, they were not hurrying
to attack the unique, two-legged
bugs by the deflated acid bag.</p>

<p>Instead, they seemed to be having
a monstrous attack of colic as
they rolled about their vanquished
monarch. With their antennae weaving
wildly, and their deadly jaws
crashing open and shut along the
floor, they were fairly wallowing
about that section. And the crowding
ring of soldiers surrounding the
wallowers were fighting like mad
things to shove them out of place.</p>

<p>Over each other they struggled
and rolled, those on the top and
sides of the solid mass pressing to
get in and down. In stark astonishment,
the two men watched the inexplicable
conflict&mdash;and wondered
why they had not already been
rushed and sliced to pieces by the
steely, ten-foot mandibles.</p>

<p>In Dennis' mind, as he watched,
wide-eyed, the crazy battle of the
monsters around the spot, a memory
struggled to be recognized. He
had seen something vaguely like
this before, on the upper earth,
what was it?</p>

<p>Abruptly he remembered what it
was. And with the recollection&mdash;and
all the possibilities of deliverance
it suggested&mdash;he shouted
aloud and clutched Jim's arm with
trembling fingers.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">That</span> scene of carnage suggested
to his mind the day he
had seen a cloud of vultures fighting
over the carcass of a horse in
the desert. The mad pushing, the
slashing and rending of each other
as all fought for the choice morsels
of dead flesh! It was identical.</p>

<p>The termites, he knew, were deliberately
cannibalistic. A race so
efficiently run, so ingenious in
letting nothing of possible value go
to waste, would almost inevitably be
trained to consume the bodies of
dead fellow beings. And now&mdash;now ...</p>

<p>The gruesome monarch, that
thing of monstrous brain and
almost nonexistent body, was no
longer the monarch. It was either
dead, or utterly helpless. In that
moment of death or helplessness&mdash;was
it being fallen upon and eaten
by the horde of savage things it normally
ruled? Did the termite hordes
make a practice of devouring their
helpless and worn-out directing brains
as it was known they devoured
all their worn-out, no longer
potent queens?</p>

<p>It certainly looked as if that was
what the leaderless horde of soldiers
was doing here! Or, at any
rate, trying to do; accustomed to
being fed by the workers, with mandibles
too huge to permit of normal
self-feeding, they would probably
be able to hardly more than strain
clumsily after the choice mass beneath
them and absorb it in morsels
so small as to be more a source
of baffled madness than of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Which latter conjecture seemed
certainly to support the theory that
the soldier termites were not trying
to help their fallen monarch, but
were trampling and slashing it to
death in an effort to devour it!</p>

<p>"Quick!" snapped Denny, realizing
that it was a chance that
must not be overlooked; that even
if he were wrong, they might as
well die trying to get to the doorway
as be crushed to death where
they stood. "Run to the exit!"</p>

<p>"Through that nightmare army?"
said Jim, astounded. "Why, we
haven't a chance of making it!"</p>

<p>"Come, I say!" Denny dragged
him a few feet by main force. "I
hope&mdash;I believe&mdash;we won't be bothered.
If a pair of jaws crushes us,
it will probably be by accident and
not design&mdash;the brutes are too busy
to bother about us now."</p>

<p>Still gazing at Denny as though
he thought him insane, Jim tarried
no longer. He began to edge his
way, by Denny's side, toward the
distant door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">In</span> a very few feet Denny's theory
was proved right. None of the
gigantic insects tried to attack
them. But even so that journey to
the exit, a distance of more than
the length of a football field, was a
ghastly business.</p>

<p>On all sides the giant, armored
bodies rushed and shoved. The
clash of horn breastplates against
armored legs, of mandibles and
granitic heads against others of
their kind, was ear-splitting. The
monsters, in their effort to indulge
the cannibalistic instinct&mdash;at once
so horrible to the two humans, and
so fortunate for them&mdash;were completely
heedless of their own welfare
and everything else.</p>

<p>Like giant ice cakes careening
in the break-up of a flood, they
crunched against each other; and
like loose ice cakes in a flood,
every now and then one was forced
clear up off its feet by the surrounding
rush, to fall back to the
floor a moment later with a resounding
crash.</p>

<p>It would seem an impossibility
for any two living things as relatively
weak and soft as men to find
a way through such a maelstrom.
Yet&mdash;Jim and Denny did.</p>

<p>Several times one or the other
was knocked down by a charging,
blind monster. Once Denny was
almost caught and crushed between
two of the rock-hard things. Once
Jim only saved himself from a pair
of terrific, snapping jaws that
rushed his way, by using his short
spear as a pole and vaulting up
and over them onto the monster's
back, where he was allowed to slide
off unheeded as the maddened thing
continued in its rush. But they
reached the door!</p>

<p>There they gazed fearfully down
the corridor, sure there would be
hundreds more of the soldiers
crowding to answer the last call of
their ruling, master mind. But only
a few stragglers were to be seen,
and these, called to the grim feast
by some sort of instinct or perhaps
some sense of smell, rushed past
with as little attempt to attack them
as the rest.</p>

<p>The two men ran down the tunnel,
turned a corner into an ascending
tunnel they remembered from
their trip in, raced up this, hearts
pounding wildly with the growing
hope of actually escaping from the
mound with their lives&mdash;and then
halted. Jim cursed bitterly, impotently.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Branching</span> off from this second
tunnel, all looking exactly
alike and all identical in the
degree of their upward slant, were
five more tunnels! Like spokes of a
wheel, they radiated out and up;
and no man could have told which
to take. They stopped, in despair,
as this phase of their situation, unthought
of till now, was brought
home to them.</p>

<p>"God! The place is a labyrinth!
How can we ever find, our way
out?" groaned Jim.</p>

<p>"All we can do is keep going on&mdash;and
up," said Denny, with a shake
of his head.</p>

<p>At random, they picked the center
of the five underground passages,
and walked swiftly along it.
And now they began to come in
contact again with the normal life
of the vast mound city.</p>

<p>Here soldiers were patrolling up
and down with seeming aimlessness,
while near-by workers labored at
shoring up collapsing sections of
tunnel wall, or at carrying staggering
large loads of food from one
unknown place to another. But now
there seemed to be a certain lack of
system, of coordination, in the
movements of the termites.</p>

<p>"Damned funny these soldiers
aren't joining in the rush with the
rest to get to the laboratory in answer
to the command of the ruler,"
said Jim, warily watching lest one
of the gigantic guards end the
queer truce and rush them. "And
look at the way the workers move&mdash;just
running aimlessly back and
forth with their loads. I don't get
it."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I&nbsp;think</span> I do," said Denny. He
pitched his voice low, and
signed for Jim to walk more slowly,
on tiptoe. "These soldiers aren't
with the rest because only a certain
number was called. It's simple
mathematics: if all the soldiers in
the mound tried to get in that room
back there where the ruler was,
they'd get jammed immovably in
the tunnels near-by. The king-termite,
with all the astounding reasoning
power it must have had,
called only as many as could crowd
in, in order to avoid a jam in which
half the soldiers in the city might
be killed.</p>

<p>"As for the aimless way the
workers are moving&mdash;you forget
they haven't a leader any more.
They are working by habit and instinct
only, carrying burdens, building
new wall sections, according to
blind custom alone, and regardless
of whether the carrying and building
are necessary."</p>

<p>"In that case," sighed Jim, "we'd
have a good chance to getting out
of here&mdash;if we could only find the
path!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can find the path,
and I'm sure we can get out," said
Denny confidently. "For in a mound
of this size there must be many
paths leading to the upper world,
and there is no reason&mdash;with the
omnipotent ruling brain dead and
eaten&mdash;why any of these creatures
should try to stop or fight us."</p>

<p>Which was good logic&mdash;but which
left entirely out of consideration
that one factor which man so often
forgets but is still inevitably governed
by: the unpredictable whims
of fate. For on their way out they
were to blunder into the one place
in all the mound which was&mdash;death
or no death of the ruling power&mdash;absolutely
deadly to them; and
were to arouse the terrible race
about them to frenzies that were
based, not on any reasoned thought
processes, or which in any case
they were of themselves incapable,
but on the more grim and fanatic
foundations of unreasoned, primal,
outraged instinct.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<i>The Termite Queen</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> slope of the upward-leading
tunnels had become less noticeable,
from which fact the two
men reasoned hopefully that they
were near ground level. And now
they began to see termite workers
bearing a new sort of burden: termite
eggs, sickly looking lumps
that had only too obviously been
newly laid.</p>

<p>A file of workers approached. In
a long line, each with an egg, looking
for all the world like a file of
human porters bearing the equipment
of a jungle expedition.
Slowly, the things moved&mdash;carefully&mdash;bound
for some such vast incubator
as the one Jim and Dennis
had stumbled into some hours before.</p>

<p>"We want to go in the opposite
direction from them," Denny whispered.
"They're coming from the
Queen termite's den&mdash;and we don't
want to blunder in there!"</p>

<p>They about-faced, and moved
with the workers till they came
to the nearest passage branching
away from the avenue on which
the file marched. Denny dabbed at
his forehead.</p>

<p>"Lucky those things came in time
to warn us," he said. "From what
little science knows of the termites,
I can guess that the Queen's
chamber would be a chamber of
horrors for us!"</p>

<p>They walked on, searching for
another main avenue, such as the
one they had left; which might be
an artery leading to the outside
world. But they had not gone far
when they were again forced to
change their course.</p>

<p>Ahead of them, marching in regular
formation, came a band of soldiers
larger than the usual squad.
They filled the tunnel so compactly
that the two men did not
dare try to squeeze past them.</p>

<p>"Here," whispered Jim, pointing
to a side tunnel.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> stole down it; but in a
moment it developed that their
choice had been an unlucky one:
the crash of the heavy, armored
bodies continued to follow them.
The soldiers had turned down that
tunnel, too.</p>

<p>"Are they after us again?" whispered
Jim.</p>

<p>Denny shrugged. There was still
a remnant of the disguising termite-paste
on their bodies to fool
the insects. It seemed impossible
that the ruling brain behind them
had survived the cannibalistic rush
and taken command of the mound
again? But&mdash;was anything impossible
in this world of terror?</p>

<p>Steadily the two were forced to
retreat before the measured advance
of the guards. And now the
tunnel they were in broadened&mdash;and
abruptly ended in another of
the vast chambers that seemed to
dot the mound city at fairly regular
intervals. But this one appeared
to be humming with activity, if the
noise coming from within it was
any indication.</p>

<p>The two passed at the threshold,
dismayed at the evidence of super-activity
in the chamber ahead of
them. But while they paused there,
the soldiers behind them rounded
a corner. They could not go back.
There were no more of the opportune
side entrances to dodge into.
All they could do was retreat still
farther&mdash;into the vast room before
them.</p>

<p>They did so, reluctantly, moving
step by step as the marching band
behind them crashed rhythmically
along. But once inside the great
chamber, they shrank back against
the wall with whispered imprecations
at the final, desperate trick
fate had played on them.</p>

<p>Their path of retreat, leading
around labyrinthine corners and by-passages,
had doubled back on them
without their having been aware
of it. They were in the very place
Dennis had wished so much to
avoid&mdash;the chamber of the Queen
termite!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">High</span> overhead, almost lost in
the dimness, was the arching
roof. Around the circular walls
were innumerable tunnel entrances.
At each of these stood a termite
guard&mdash;picked soldiers half again
as large as the ordinary soldiers,
with mandibles so great and heavy
that it was a marvel the insects
could support them.</p>

<p>Hurrying here and there were
worker termites. And these were
centering their activities on an object
as fearful as anything that ever
haunted the mind of a madman.</p>

<p>Up and back, this object loomed,
half filling the enormous room like
a zeppelin in a hangar. And like a
zeppelin&mdash;a blunt, bloated zeppelin&mdash;the
object was circular and tapered
at both ends. But the zeppelin
was a living thing&mdash;a horrible travesty
of life.</p>

<p>At the end facing the two men
was a tiny dot of a head, almost
lost in the whitish mass of the
enormous body. Around this a cluster
of worker termites pressed, giving
nourishment to the insatiable
mouth. At the far end of the vast
shape another cluster of termites
thronged. And these bore away a
constant stream of termite eggs&mdash;that
dripped from the zeppelinlike,
crammed belly at the rate of almost
one a second.</p>

<p>Her Highness, the Queen&mdash;two
hundred tons of flabby, greasy flesh,
immobile, able only to eat and lay
eggs.</p>

<p>"My God," whispered Jim. Utterly
unstrung, he gazed at that
mighty, loathsome mass, listening
to its snapping jaws as it took on
the tons of nourishment needed for
its machinelike functioning. "My
God!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Instinctively</span> he whirled to
run back through the entrance
they had come through. But now,
with the admittance of the soldier
band that had pressed them in here,
the entrance was guarded again by
one of the giants permanently stationed
there.</p>

<p>"What had we better do?" he
breathed to Denny.</p>

<p>Dennis stared helplessly around.
He had noticed that the termites
in here were acting differently from
the others they had encountered
since leaving the lair of the termite-ruler.
These were moving uneasily,
restlessly, stopping now and
again with waving, inquisitive antennae.
It looked ominously as
though they had sensed the presence
of intruders here in the sanctum
where their race was born, and
were dimly wondering what to do.</p>

<p>"We might try each tunnel
mouth, one by one, on the chance
that we can find a careless guard
somewhere," Dennis muttered at
last. "But for heaven's sake don't
touch any of the brutes! I think
that at the slightest signal the
whole mob of the things would
spring on us and tear us to pieces.
Most of the paste is rubbed off by
now."</p>

<p>Jim nodded. He had no desire to
brush against one of the colossal,
special guard of soldiers if he could
help it, or against any of the relatively
weak workers that might
give the signal of alarm.</p>

<p>Stealing silently along among the
blind, instinctively agitated monsters,
they worked a circuitous way
from one exit to another. But nowhere
did any chance of getting
out of the place present itself.
Across each tunnel mouth was
placed one of the enormous guards,
twelve-foot mandibles opened like
a waiting steel trap.</p>

<p>Halfway around the tremendous
room they went, without mishap,
but also without finding an exit
they could slip through. And then,
in the rear of the vast bulk of the
Queen, it happened.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">One</span> of the worker termites,
bearing an egg in its mandibles,
faltered, and dropped its
precious burden. The thing fell
squashily to the floor within a foot
of Jim, who had brushed against
the wall to let the burden bearer
pass without touching him. Jim,
attempting to sidestep away from
the spot, as the worker put out
blind feelers, to search for the
dropped egg, lost his balance for a
fraction of a second&mdash;and stepped
squarely on the nauseous ovoid!</p>

<p>Frantically he stepped out of the
mess he had created, and the two
stood staring at each other, holding
their breaths, fearful of what might
result from that accidental destruction
of budding termite life.</p>

<p>The worker, feeling about for its
burden, came in contact with the
shattered egg. It drew back
abruptly, as though in perplexity:
soft and tough, the egg should not
have broken merely from being
dropped. Then it felt again....</p>

<p>For a few seconds nothing whatever
occurred. The two breathed
again, and began to hope that their
fears had been meaningless. But
that was not to be.</p>

<p>The worker termite finally began
to rush back and forth, antennae
whipping from side to side, patently
trying to discover the cause
of the tragedy. And Jim and Dennis
rushed back and forth, too, engaged
in a deadly game of blind
man's buff as they tried to avoid the
questing antennae&mdash;which, registering
sensation by touch instead of
smell, was not to be fooled by the
last disappearing traces of the termite-paste.</p>

<p>The game did not last long. One
of the feelers whipped against
Dennis' legs&mdash;and hell broke loose!</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> worker emitted a sound
like the shriek of a circular
saw gone wild. And on the instant
all its fellows, and the gigantic
guards at the exits, stiffened to
rigid attention.</p>

<p>Again came the roaring sound,
desolate, terrible, at once a call to
arms and a funeral dirge. And now
every termite in the dim, cavernous
chamber began the battle dance
Jim and Dennis had seen performed
by the termite guard when it was
confronted by the horde of ants.
Not moving their feet, they commenced
to sway back and forth,
while long, rhythmic shudders convulsed
their grotesque bodies. It
was a formal declaration of war
against whatever mad things had
dared invade the fountain-spring of
their race.</p>

<p>Jim and Dennis leaped toward
the nearest exit, determined to take
any risk on the chance of escaping
from the horde of things now
aware of their presence and ravening
for their blood. But in this exit&mdash;the
only one accessible to them
now&mdash;the guard had commenced
the jaw-clashing that closed openings
more efficiently than steel
plates could have done. An attempt
to pass those enormous mandibles
presented no risk; what it presented
was suicide.</p>

<p>By now the dread war dance had
stopped. All the termites in the
chamber were converging slowly
toward the spot where the termite
had given the rasping alarm. Even
the workers, ordinarily quick to run
from danger, were advancing instead
of retreating. Of all living
things in the room only the Queen,
unable to move her mountainous
bulk, did not join in the slow, sure
move to slash to pieces the hated
trespassers.</p>

<p>Again the questing antennae of
the worker that had given the alarm
touched one of the men. With a
deafening rasp it sprang toward
them, blind but terrible.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dennis</span> swung his steel club.
It clashed against the scarcely
less hard mandibles of the worker,
not harming them, but seeming to
daze the insect a little.</p>

<p>Jim followed the act by plunging
his longer spear into the soft body.
No words were wasted by the two
men. It was a fight for life again,
with the odds even more heavily
against them than they had been
in the ruler's lair.</p>

<p>Behind them, blocking the only
exit they had any chance whatever
of reaching, the guard continued
its clashing mandible duty. If only
it, too, would join in the blind
search for the trespassers, thus
giving them an opportunity of
slipping out! But the monster gave
no indication of doing such a thing.</p>

<p>Another worker termite flung its
bulk at them. Its mandibles, tiny in
comparison with those of the great
guards but still capable of slicing
either of the men in two, snapped
perilously close to Jim's body.
There was a second's concerted
action: Dennis' club lashed against
the thing's head, Jim's spear tore
into the vulnerable body.</p>

<p>Ringing them round, the main
band of the termites moved closer.
They moved slowly, in no hurry,
apparently only too sure the enemy
could not possibly get away from
them. And the two worker termites
killed were mere incidents compared
to the avalanche of mandible
and horn that would be on them
in about thirty seconds.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">However</span>, the two dead termites
gave Jim a sudden inspiration.
He glanced from the carcasses
to the mechanically moving,
deadly jaws of the guard that
barred the nearest exit.</p>

<p>"Denny," he panted, "feed it
this."</p>

<p>He pointed first toward the
nearest carcass and then toward the
rock-crushing, steadily snapping
jaws.</p>

<p>"I'll try to hold the bridge
here&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Dennis was on his way,
catching Jim's idea with the first
gesture.</p>

<p>He stooped down, and caught the
dead termite by two of its legs.
Close to two hundred pounds the
mass weighed; but strength is an
inconstant thing, and increases or
decreases according to the vital
needs of life-preservation.</p>

<p>Clear of the floor, Denny lifted
the bulk, and with its repulsive
weight clasped in his arms, he advanced
toward the mighty guard.</p>

<p>Behind him, Jim glared desperately
at the third termite that was
about to attack. No feeble worker
this, but one of the most colossal of
all the Queen's guard.</p>

<p>Towering over Jim, mandibles
wide open and ready to smash over
its prey, the giant reared toward
him. And behind him came the main
body of the horde. It was painfully
evident that the clash with the lone
soldier would be the last single encounter.
After that the hundreds of
the herd would be on the men, tearing
and trampling them to bits.</p>

<p>During the thing's steady, inexorable
approach, which had taken
far less time than that required to
tell of it, Jim had clenched his fingers
around his spear and calculated
as to the best way to hold the
monster off for just the few seconds
needed by Denny to try the
plan suggested.</p>

<p>The monster ended its slow advance
in a lunge, that, for all its
great bulk, was lightning quick. But
a shade more quickly, Jim sidestepped
the terrible mandibles,
leaped back along the armored body
till he had reached the unarmored
rear, and thrust his spear home with
all his force.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> hideous guard reared with
pain and rage. But this was no
worker termite, to be killed with a
thrust. As though nothing had happened,
the huge hulk wheeled
around. The mandibles crashed shut
with deafening force over the space
Jim had occupied but an instant before.</p>

<p>And now the inner circle of the
multiple ring of death was within
a few yards. Jim leaped to put himself
behind the living barrier of the
attacking soldier. But it was only
a matter of a few seconds now, before
he and Denny would be caught
in the blind bull charges of the
wounded soldier or by the surrounding
ring of maddened termites.</p>

<p>"Denny?" he shouted imploringly
over his shoulder, not daring to
take his eyes off the danger in front
of him.</p>

<p>"Soon!" he heard Dennis pant.</p>

<p>The entomologist had got almost
up to the twelve-foot jaws that
closed the exit. He paused a moment,
gathering strength. Then he
heaved the soft mass of the dead
termite into the clashing mandibles.</p>

<p>"Jim!" he cried, as the burden
left his arms.</p>

<p>Jim turned, raced the few yards
intervening between the ring of
death and the doorway. Together
they waited to see if their forlorn
hope would work....</p>

<p>It could not have lasted more
than a second, that wait, yet it
seemed at least ten minutes. And
then both cried aloud&mdash;and
crouched to repeat the maneuver
that had saved them from death
when they had first entered this insect
hell.</p>

<p>For the enormous, smashing jaws
had caught the body of the worker
termite with ferocious eagerness,
and were worrying the inanimate
carcass with terrible force.</p>

<p>The great jaws were occupied
just an instant before the monster
sensed that it was one of his own
kind that he was mangling so thoroughly.
But in that instant Jim had
slid on his chest along the floor
past the armored head and shoulders,
and Dennis had leaped to follow.</p>

<p>But Dennis was not to get off so
lightly.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> charging ring of termites
had closed completely in by
now. The snapping mandibles of
the nearest one were up to him.
They opened; shut.</p>

<p>They caught Denny on the back
swing, knocking him six feet away
instead of slicing him wide open.
Denny got to his feet almost before
he had landed; but between him
and the exit was the bulk of the
termite that had felled him, and in
the doorway the guard had dropped
the body it was slashing to bits,
and had recommenced its slashing
jaw movements.</p>

<p>"Jim! For God's sake...."
shrieked the doomed man.</p>

<p>Beside himself, he managed to
hurdle clear over the massive insect
between him and the doorway. But
there he stopped, with the guard's
great mandibles fanning the air less
than a foot from him. "Jim!" came
the agonized cry again.</p>

<p>And behind the gigantic termite,
in the tunnel, with at least a possibility
of safety lying open before
him, Jim heard and answered the
call.</p>

<p>Savagely he plunged his spear
into the unarmored rear of the
guard, tore it out, thrust again....</p>

<p>The thing heaved and struggled
to turn, shaking the tunnel with its
rasping anger&mdash;and taking its attention
at last away from the duty of
closing that tunnel mouth.</p>

<p>With no room to run and slide,
Denny fell to the floor and commenced
to creep through the narrow
space between the trampling
guard's bulk and the wall. He felt
his left arm and shoulder go numb
as he was crushed for a fleeting instant
against the wood partition.
Broken, he thought dimly. The collar-bone.
But still he kept moving
on.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> moved in a haze of pain and
weakness. He did not see that
he had passed clear of the menacing
hulk&mdash;that his slow crawling
had been multiplied in results by
the fact that the termite guard had
finally, stopped trying to turn in
the narrow passage and had rushed
ahead into the Queen's chamber, to
turn there and come dashing back.
He did not see that Jim was finally
disarmed and completely helpless,
with his spear buried beyond recovery
in the bulk of the maddened
guard. He hardly felt Jim's supporting
arm as it was thrust under
him, to half drag and half lead him
along the tunnel away from the
horde behind.</p>

<p>He only knew that they were
moving forward, with the din behind
them&mdash;as the grim cohorts of
the Queen fought to all crowd
ahead in the narrow passage at once&mdash;keeping
pace with them in spite
of all they could do to make haste.
And he only knew that finally Jim
gave a great shout, and that suddenly
they were standing under a
rent in a tunnel roof through which
sunlight was pouring.</p>

<p>Several worker termites were laboring
to close up the chink and cut
off the sunlight; but these, not
being of the band outraged by the
destruction of the egg in the
Queen's chamber, moved swiftly
away as the two men advanced.</p>

<p>Jim reached up and tore with
frantic hands at the crumbling
edges of the rotten wood overhead.
Ignoring his gashed and bleeding
fingers, he widened the breach till
he, could pull himself up through
it. Then he reached down, caught
Denny's sound arm, and raised him
by main strength.</p>

<p>They were in the clear air of the
outer world once more, on a terrace
in the mound low down near its
base.</p>

<p>Jim and Dennis half slid, half fell
down the near terrace slope to the
jungle of grass stalks beneath. And
there Denny bit his lip sharply,
struggled against the weakness
overcoming him&mdash;and fainted.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jim</span> caught him up over his shoulder,
and staggered forward
through the jungle. Behind, the termites
poured out through the
broken wall in an enraged flood,
braving even the sunlight and outer
air in their chase of the invaders
that had, profaned the Queen's
chamber.</p>

<p>"Matt!" shouted Jim with all the
strength of his lungs, forgetting
that his voice could not be heard
by normal human ears. "Matt!"</p>

<p>But if Matthew Breen could not
hear, he could see. The slightest inattention
at his guard duty at that
second would have resulted in two
deaths. But he was on the alert.</p>

<p>Jim saw the sun blotted out
swiftly, saw a huge, pinkish-gray
wall swoop down between him and
Denny, and the deadly horde of termites
pursuing them. Then he saw
another pinkish-gray wall, in which
was set something&mdash;a shallow, regular,
hollowed plateau&mdash;that looked
familiar. The patty-dish in which he
and Denny had been carried to this
place of death and horror.</p>

<p>Jim knew he could not clamber
into that great plateau; he was too
exhausted. But the necessity was
spared him.</p>

<p>The patty-dish scooped down
under him, uprooting huge trees,
digging up square yards of earth all
around him. He was flung from his
feet to roll helplessly beside the
unconscious Dennis, as men and
earth and all were shifted from
the dish's rim to its center.</p>

<p>Like gigantic express elevator
the dish soared dizzily up in the
tremendous hand that held it, over
the vast pile of the mound city,
over all the surrounding landscape,
and was borne back toward Matt's
automobile&mdash;and toward the laboratory
where the bulk of their bodies
waited, in protoplasmic form, in the
dome of the glass bell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<i>Back to Normal</i></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I&nbsp;think</span>," said Jim, loading his
pipe, "that now I really will
settle down. No other adventures
could seem like much after the one"&mdash;he
repressed a shiver&mdash;"we've just
passed through."</p>

<p>"And I think," said Dennis, following
his own line of thought,
"that as far the world of science
goes, my exploring has been for
nothing. Try to tell sober scientists
of the specially evolved, huge-brained
thing that rules the termite
tribe and forms and holds the
marvelous organization it has? Try
to tell them&mdash;now that Matt has
to stubbornly decided to keep secret
his work with element eighty-five&mdash;that
we were reduced to a
quarter of an inch in height, and
that we went through a mound and
saw at first hand the things we describe?
They'd shut me in an
asylum!"</p>

<p>The two were sitting in Denny's
apartment, once more conventionally
clothed, and again their normal
five feet eleven, and six feet two.</p>

<p>The reassembling of Denny's
body had done odd things. Jim had
set the broken bone with rough
skill before stepping under the
glass bell; and the fracture had
been healed automatically by the
growing deposit of protoplasmic
substance resulting when Matt
threw his switch.</p>

<p>But Denny's missing finger had
baffled the reversing process. With
no tiny pattern to form around, the
former substance of his finger had
simply gathered in a shapeless knob
of flesh and bone like a tumorous
growth sprouting from his hand. It
would have to be amputated.</p>

<p>But the marvels performed under
Matthew Breen's glass bell were far
secondary to the two men. The
things they had recently seen and
undergone, and the possibility of
telling folks about them, occupied
their attention exclusively.</p>

<p>"Then you're not going to write
a monograph on the real nature of
termites, as you'd planned?" Jim
asked Denny.</p>

<p>Denny shrugged dispiritedly.
"People would take it for a joke
instead of a scientific treatise if I
did," he said.</p>

<p>Jim puffed reflectively at his
pipe. A thought had come, to him
that seemed to hold certain elements
of possibility.</p>

<p>"Why not do this," he suggested:
"Write it up first as a straight
story, and see if people will believe
it. Then, if they do, you can rewrite
it as scientific fact."</p>

<p>And eventually they decided to
do just that. And&mdash;here is their
story.</p>
